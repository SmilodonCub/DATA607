"4","I actually worked for a season next to the DAIP office in Duluth. They were extremely sexist. I was informed that walking down the hall to the shared bathroom was too intimidating because I was male and many of their program attendees had issues with males. Sometimes ~~if~~ I'd go and wash my hands and forget to lock the door. They called and complained to my boss and said that of a woman opened the door and i was in the bathroom, she's be intimidated because I was male."
"5","That closely mirrors a bad experience I had with those groups as well. My cousin worked in a women's shelter, and asked me one weekend to help them out with some moving they were doing. I went by the address she gave me, and looked for someone, and waited in my car for about 15 minutes. Finally, someone approached me cautiously and asked who I was. I gave them my cousin's name and told them I'd been asked to come by and help out. They knew extra people had been asked to help, but thought I looked dangerous, and I was told they thought I was some husband who had found the location of the shelters and was...well, you get the idea.

Yeah, right. I was pretty shocked by that. I mean, I was still a teenager or just a year out of high school, and somehow I look like a dangerous abuser? Even as young as I was though, I knew enough to immediately GTFO. I just said ""oh well, you're probably mostly done, so I'll just go"" and didn't look back. My cousin tried to apologize later, but I just told her: ""Don't worry about it, I learned a lot"", and let her think whatever she wanted about what I'd learned, because it certainly wasn't anything good about those places.

You know, I was just talking with some male friends about how many times in our lives we've been instinctively seen and treated as a threat without any justification, and I realized after some thinking that I can't even count them all. It's probably somewhere in the 50-100 range or thereabouts, but that's still only the ones that I can say for sure. There are certainly more that I was probably not even aware of."
"6","The more important issue is that this is disabling and disempowering.

Shelters have a great *need* for men who are safe.  Trauma survivors require the presence of triggers in order to become desensitized to those triggers and practice their coping strategies.  

Creating a 'male-free' environment is more likely to create greater degrees of generalization as the client is taught to avoid any and all stimuli that might produce discomfort.

"7","Like, you mean that feminists method create more damage, instead of helping? Who would have thought.

I mean, it's been long known that abusers have very often been abused themselves in their youth, so it would seem evident that by hiding half the abusers, they actually help perpetuate the issue, and that most of the abused women of today could blame feminists for refusing to acknowledge the women responsible for the abuse of their abuser, and perpetuating the circle.

But at the same time, if they did acknowledge women abuser, then the number of abused people would drastically drop, so the number of future abuser would also drop, which in turn would diminish a lot the cash-cow the feminist movement has been milking for decades. And they can't have that."

[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228350210\_Gender\_symmetry\_in\_partner\_violence\_The\_evidence\_the\_denial\_and\_the\_implications\_for\_primary\_prevention\_and\_treatment](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228350210_Gender_symmetry_in_partner_violence_The_evidence_the_denial_and_the_implications_for_primary_prevention_and_treatment)

**Method 1. Suppress Evidence**

Researchers with a commitment to the idea that men are almost always the sole perpetrator, or whose commitment to increase services to women victims of PV is so strong that it overrides their commitment to science, as shown previously, often leads to concealing evidence that contradicts this belief. In addition, many researchers not committed to that ideology have withheld results showing gender symmetry to avoid becoming victims of vitriolic denunciations and ostracism (see Method 7 below). A typical pattern is to publish only the data on male perpetrators or female victims, deliberately omitting data on female perpetrators and male victims. This practice started with one of the first general population surveys on family violence. The survey done for the Kentucky Commission On The Status Of Women obtained data on both men and women, but only the data on male perpetration was published (Schulman, 1979). Among the many other examples of respected researchers publishing data on assaults by men and the data on assaults by women are Kennedy and Dutton (1989), Lackey and Williams (1995), Johnson and Leone (2005), and Kaufman Kantor and Straus (1987). 

**Method 2. Avoid Obtaining Or Analyzing Data On Female Perpetration**

Due to prevailing ideology that women are almost never perpetrators of PV and men are almost never victims, researchers designing surveys have typically asked female participants only about attacks by their male partners, and male respondents only about perpetration. To achieve this, the Canadian national Violence Against Women survey (Johnson &amp; Sacco, 1995), modified the Conflict Tactics Scales by omitting the questions on perpetration by the female participants in the study. The American National Violence Against Women Survey (Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000) sponsored by the Department of Justice originally planned the same strategy. Fortunately, the US Centers For Disease Control added a sample of men to the project. But when Johnson and Leone (Johnson &amp; Leone, 2005) investigated the prevalence of intimate terrorists among the participants in that study, they guaranteed there would be no female intimate terrorists by using only the data on male perpetration. Many other studies of PV have also omitted questions about female perpetration and male victimization. Many, agencies do not permit collection of data on PV unless questions on female perpetration are omitted. This may have been the reason that a comprehensive four site study of batterer treatment programs asked the women only about violence by the partner (Gondolf, 2002). This was a tremendous lost opportunity because it may be the only comprehensive study of male offenders which had access to their female partners.

**Method 3. Cite Only Studies That Show Male Perpetration**

Another method used to conceal evidence of gender symmetry is to selectively cite studies of male perpetration and avoid citing studies of female perpetration. US government, World Health Organization, and United Nations documents show that this method of concealment and distortion is institutionalized in official publications. For example, US Dept of Justice publications almost always cite only the National Crime Victimization study, which shows male predominance (Durose et al., 2005). They fail to mention the Department Of Justice published critiques which led to a revision of the survey. but which that only partly corrected that bias (Straus, 1999). Not only do Department of Justice publications on PV rely on data that they previously acknowledged is inaccurate for measuring PV, but they also ignore a major and more accurate study that they themselves sponsored  the National Violence Against Women .Survey. This study found that women perpetrate about 40% of PV incidents, which is close to gender symmetry in perpetration

The widely acclaimed and influential World Health Organization report on domestic violence (Krug et al., 2002) reports that Where violence by women occurs it is more likely to be in the form of self-defense (32, 37, 38). This is selective citation because almost all studies that have compared men and women find about equal rates of self-defense. Perhaps even worse, none of the three studies cited provide evidence supporting the quoted sentence. For example, Study #32 (Saunders &amp; Hanusa, 1986) shows that about two thirds of female perpetrated PV was not in self-defense. Study #37 (DeKeseredy, Saunders, Schwartz, &amp; Shahid, 1997) found that only 7% of women said their violence was in self-defense. Study #38 (Johnson &amp; Ferraro, 2000) is a review paper that has no original data. It cites #32 and #37, neither of which supports the claim.

A closely related method is to present the results on female perpetration/male victimization and say nothing about those results. The 2006 US Department of Justice report on PV gives a chart showing trends for both men and women from 1993 to 2004 (Catalano, 2006b). The only thing said about trends in male victimization, i.e. female perpetration, is that The rate of nonfatal intimate partner victimization for males increased between 2003 and 2004, returning to levels last seen in 1996 (and)1...for white males... (victimization)...increased between 2003 and 2004, from 0.5 to 1.1... It is almost certain that that there would be a commentary and an extensive analysis if Nonfatal PV victimization of white females had increased between 2003 and 2004, from .5 to 1.1 victimizations per 1,000 i.e., if the female victimization rate had doubled. But the doubling in the male victimization rate was ignored."
"12","**Method 4. Conclude That Results Refute Symmetry When They Do Not**

The studies cited above, in addition to be illustrating selective citation, are also examples of the ability of ideological commitment to lead researchers to misinterpret the results of their own research. A study by Kernsmith (2005), for example states that Males and females were found to differ in their motivations for using violence in relationships. (p. 173), and that ""female violence may be more related to maintaining personal liberty in a relationship than gaining power"" (p. 180). Although Kernsmiths Table 2 shows that women had higher scores on the striking back factor, only one question in this factor is about self-defense and this item is endorsed infrequently. Other more frequently endorsed items are about being angry (e.g., ""to show anger"") and getting back at a partner (e.g. ""to get back at your partner for hurting you emotionally""). In contrast to the idea that women use violence to maintain liberty, these finding suggest that women are more likely than men to use violence in retaliatory anger. In addition, Kernsmiths conclusion ignores the fact that the scores for men and women were approximately equal in respect to two of the three factors (exerting power and disciplining partner).Thus, Kernsmiths study generally found the opposite of what was stated as the finding.

**Method 5. Create Evidence By Citation**

The Kernsmiths study, the World Health Organization report, and the pattern of selective citation show how ideology can be converted into evidence by citation or what Gelles (1980) calls the woozle effect. A woozle effect occurs when the frequent citation of assertion in previous publications that lack evidence mislead us into thinking there is evidence. For example, subsequent to the World Health Organization study and the Kernsmith study, papers discussing gender differences in motivation will cite them to show that female violence is predominantly in self-defense, which is the opposite of what the research actually shows. But because these are citations of an article in a scientific journal and a respected international organization, readers of the subsequent article will accept it as a fact. Thus, fiction is converted into scientific evidence that will be cited over and over and further strengthen the woozle effect.

Another well documented example is the claim that the Conflict Tactics Scales (Straus, Hamby, Boney-McCoy, &amp; Sugarman, 1996) does not provide an adequate measure of PV because it measures only conflict related violence. Although the theoretical basis of the CTS is conflict theory, the introductory explanation to participants specifically asks participants to report expressive and malicious violence. It asks respondents about the times when they and their partner ...disagree, get annoyed with the other person, want different things from each other, or just have spats or fights because they are in a bad mood, are tired or for some other reason. Despite repeating this criticism for 25 years in perhaps a hundred publications, we have not located any empirical study which has provided evidence showing that only conflict-related violence is reported. In fact, where there is both CTS data and qualitative data, as in Giles-Sims (1983), it shows that the CTS elicits malicious violence as well as conflict-related violence. Nevertheless, because there are at least a hundred articles with this statement in peer reviewed journals, it is treated as an established scientific fact.

**Method 6. Obstruct Funding of Research That Might Contradict the Idea that Male Dominance Is The Cause of PV**

An example of denying funding to research that might contradict the idea that PV is a male-only crime is the call for proposals to investigate PV issued in December 2005 by the National Institute of Justice. The announcement stated that proposals to investigate male victimization would not be eligible. Another example is the objection by a reviewer to a proposal one of us submitted because of ...naming violence in a relationships as a human problem of aggression not a gender-based problem. When priority scores by the reviewers are averaged, it takes only one extremely low score to place the proposal below the fundable level. Others have encountered similar blocks; for example Holtzworth-Munroe (2005). Eugen Lupri, a pioneer Canadian family violence researcher, has also documented examples of the resistance to funding and publishing research on female perpetrated violence (Lupri, 2004).

**Method 7. Harass, Threaten, And Penalize Researchers Who Produce Evidence That Contradicts Feminist Beliefs**

Suzanne Steinmetz made the mistake of publishing a book and articles (Steinmetz, 1977; Steinmetz, 1977-1978) which clearly showed about equal rates of perpetration by males and females. Anger over this resulted in a bomb threat at her daughters wedding and she was the object of a letter writing campaign to deny her promotion and tenure at the University of Delaware. Twenty years later the same processes resulted in a lecturer at the University of Manitoba whose dissertation found gender symmetry in PV being denied promotion and tenure.

A PhD student working with Straus was warned at a conference that she will never get a job if she does her PhD research with him. At the University of Massachusetts, Straus was prevented from speaking by shouts and stomping. At two hearings held by the Canadian Commission On Violence Against Women the chairperson stated that nothing Murray Straus publishes can be believed because he is a wife-beater and sexually exploits students (Toronto Magazine article, ??). When Straus was elected President of the Society For the Study Of Social Problems, a group of members occupied the first few rows of the auditorium and, at the start of the presidential address, stood up and walked out.

As a result of these types of harassment, there is widespread self-censorship by authors who fear that publishing politically incorrect data will undermine their reputation, or in the case of graduate students, their ability to obtain a job."

We always have reasons, stupid as they can seem when out of the fog, for staying until we finally leave those relationships... for me it was my son, but he was also my strength and the reason I left as soon as the violence got its worst and the third time that night I walked away she called and lied to police.

My dad saved my ass.  He came and bailed me out after the 2-4 days I ended up having to mandatory stay (because of county verse state laws and my first near 24 hours in city, had to do more in county after transfer).  I was pretty fucking close to whatever I can imagine feeling shell shocked must be.  He let me pay him back after getting my finances straight (and helped me think through how to provide for her / my kid while protecting myself and initiating a divorce).  I stayed there for 6 months until I could get her to accept appropriate mediation (would have taken over a year to get any kind of 'emergency custody' or divorce / custody hearing).  I still was too lenient, let her 'waste' over 8 grand before that 6 month period, but I was also playing a longer game to go for full custody in court if she didn't mediate in a way okay for my son and I prior.

"21","I'm amazed at how many people believe domestic violence and sexual abuse are about control. It boggles my mind.

Sure, there are psychopaths where that is happening. But the bulk of it is just people behaving badly.

People feel hurt and anger and they act out and hurt.

Rape especially is perpetrated on younger and prettier men and women. Not because they are powerless, but because they are desired.

Sex abuse with children seems very much to be about a twisted sexual fulfillment as well. From the limited reading I've done it is very much about opportunity and fantasy fulfillment. 
.
Is that a power fantasy? Probably not. I suspect it is more about neotony. All those sexual characteristics of youth that are desired in young adults as targets might also be there in children to some degree.

That last bit about kids is much more speculative than my earlier this about adults."
"22","Ya, the rape part is so out of focus it blows the mind.  In a lot of western countries there is no rape law for men by a woman,  it hidden in lesser charge of forced to penetrate.  It means that if a man comes forward the lesser charge will probably get her a fine or community service and generally are suspended sentences if any.  So no criminal record, no forced to register as a sex offender, and so on.  Well it is Rape and if you include it as rape the male and female rates  of rape get fairly close to equal, in some areas its more.  If you add prison men get raped way more than women.  So do all those women rape men fore power?  I doubt it.    But for some reason its all about the power according to feminist theory but only if men do it.  The Duluth model, total crap.  Hell if I apply the feminist standards of rape Ive been raped. 3 times by women.  Sexually abuse.  I worked in a dance bar first as a bouncer then as a waiter (way better money in tips). I was 19, (Canada). A ranked elite rugby player, and good looking.  Well our uniform was a black bow tie black shorts or pants and white dress shirt.  Thing cheep chip and dales.  Well I was physically sexually assaulted at least 3 times a night. Groped grabbed and fondled.  Hell I cant count the number of times I had to dig my tip out of my underwear.  But for some reason its funny or sexy when men get sexually harassed or assaulted, if a man did a fraction of what I received regularly hed be out on his ass in 10 seconds.  Check out the multiple videos done by students in psychology demonstrating the hypocrisy.    Men get abused and assaulted by a women in the park draws people who watch, laugh, calls out from women as encouragement.  Some even take selfies or video of it.  I think of all the ones Ive seen only one women tried to intervene.  When asked by the student group what the thought, most common answer was he probably deserved it.

"26","&gt; Services do exist for men, they are much more scarce yes, but I believe the way to go about change is to build up support for men, not tear down support for women.

Who is planning to tear down support for women, though?  What made you assume critiquing this regressive model would even infer it as attacking an entire gender?

&gt;I see this model being frequently attacked on this sub

And there's been concrete evidence that it deserves the ire we lob at it.  The obvious one being it doesn't exactly help a male victim of domestic violence to be assumed the dangerous one and carted off to jail.

&gt;but nobody is ever talking about what to do different...

How about treating every domestic violence situation case by case instead of going in with a misandric theory that paints the male gender as always at fault?  That would be a start."
"27","The biggest issues I have with it can be framed within the words used by the framework.

Under the Duluth model, one party is ""the one to define what actions are abusive"".  Just as the model states that ""being the one to define male and female roles"" is a category of power and control, so is having one person define abuse.  

Combine that with ""Making her afraid by..."" and the presence of 'looks' and 'gestures'.

That allows for a situation where getting angry is defined as abuse.  I know for a fact that when I'm upset, my nostrils flare and I start to raise my voice.  That's not abusive behavior.  That's an autonomic response to being frustrated or angry.  

The Duluth Model creates a weird power dynamic where basically anyone can be defined as abusive. 

That makes it unhelpful.

I have worked with some people who used the model, and it almost always escalated issues rather than deescalating.

For a better way to work through things, I recommend basically any communication enhancing tool.  Even simple things like getting people to use ""I feel"" statements and expressing their wants in clear terms works much better.

One of my favorites is just to ask both parties to write down their expectations and their responsibilities.

Even when working with abusive relationships, using those techniques exposed abuse far more readily than trying to analyze the behaviors themselves.  Having one partner talk on and on about their expectations and go silent when asked about their responsibilities isn't exactly subtle, and exposes the underlying issue, that being that one partner is being a selfish fuckwit and wants a lot while giving very little.

Basically, it's too simple for therapy, too broad for the courtroom, and really doesn't offer much beyond raising awareness."
"28","&gt; Services do exist for men

&gt; male behavior change program 

Right, and how many female behavior change programs do the offer? How many male victim services?

&gt; build up support for men, not tear down support for women

It's not about tearing down support for anyone. Only that the criteria for support should not be based on gender.

Duluth model also guides arrest policies FYI. One of the reasons that abused men get arrested is because they show police all these biased stats about how 98% of DV victims are female, and how the primary aggressor is the one that is more 'physically intimidating' or 'capable of causing injury'. It also describes female violence as inherently 'defensive'."
"29","Nobody wants to tear down support for women.  But men are not even allowed to ask for support, much less have it.  Read up on the tremendous amounts of opposition (up to and including salacious, libelous attacks on the advocates) faced by those wanting to build men's shelters and nothing more."
"30","I will chime in with my two cents since I work with the same stack as you - if you aren't a great data architect, that'd be a good skill to pick up. Building pipelines is great, but understanding the pros and cons of streaming analytics vs. building a daily process. I also think learning a bit of OOP to help, which it sounds like you're doing (Java UDFs, UDAFs, Python) to allow you to manipulate those massive data sets effectively - or even using Spark for streaming since you're using Kafka quite a bit.

Scala and Spark aren't going anywhere anytime soon. Same with Apache Flink, though that's still in the nurture phase.

You won't see any companies aside from cutting edge using Kafka or Spark streaming, etc., so it's best to keep the old skill architecture and business acumen fresh as well.

Contributing to open source is a phenomenal idea. You'll learn a lot AND you'll be able to stay on top of new tech. That keeps you desireable in the marketplace.

2. You can do powerful find/replace commands. I have taken rows of Excel strings that I want to convert into a comma list for use in R that take seconds to format in Sublime. Find and replace ""\n"" "", "" to turn every new line entry into a comma separated list that can be copied and pasted into R/Python.

3. Ctrl+Shift+K otherwise known as multiple selections. You can edit in more than one place at once. It works as a quick substitute for find and replace, or to apply the same sequence of changes to multiple lines simultaneously. Basically, let's say you want to add the same text to 40 lines of code but in different places. You can multiple select all the places you want something then type it out and it appears in every selection space.

"51","Learn To Code is the most appropriate meme ever created, since it's origin was in the cold and generally inconsiderate response journalists and writers kept giving manufacturing workers whenever their jobs went overseas. Besides being unethical, it's bad journalism since half of journalism requires at least a tactful approach to sources and topics so that they'll be honest when giving information and lead to better information/sources being provided.

This isn't a tech problem, it's an ethics problem. The general decline of journalist unions (which horrifyingly mirrors the decline of manufacturing unions) and tentpole journalism (print newspapers, broadcast radio, broadcast TV) has caused the entire industry to be overrun by people who treat daily periodicals like their blog or a book and don't give it the serious, objective analysis befitting of a journal. This, inevitably, leads to trust in the media deteriorating as it stops fulfilling it's original function of information gathering and storage (which is a thing the web age never concerns itself with, unless you're a software pirate)."

"55","Publicly funded media, arts programs, and stipends for books wouldn't have prevented this since the problem also exists in countries that have all of that where people simply choose commercial services instead, in no small part because commercial media tells people exactly what they want to hear.

Not that I necessary disagree with your point, but I consider it misguided. The lack of any sort of web marketing regulation certainly contributes to the deluge of clickbait, garbage reporting, and tweeting masquerading as journalism but the problem existed before the web got big. It's at least 40 years in the making, and a direct result of individual people themselves deciding they don't want good journalism. Everyone getting pocket communicators was just the breaking point when a majority of society decided they wanted to define their reality, rather than accept it served to them.

On an even more basic level: how do we get children into reading? This was a problem that people began to notice in the 1970s, and could never find a solution to it (Barbera Bush really did try hard though). The next two decades were largely defined by MTV as cable spread, and people chose to give their attention to TV instead of public libraries built over the preceding 50 years. This proved true even within the Soviet Union (a non-capitalist state), where pirated VHS tapes were sought after goods.

Choice and spectacle are addicting, it's easier for someone to just follow a circus (any circus) then sit in a quiet room staring at text. Even if the US adopted full socialism, I don't see how this could be changed."
"56","The problem is journalists. ""Journalism"" nowadays is scarcely more than blue-checkmarks finding the latest thing to be outraged about. ""Journalists"" employed at major neoliberal media corporations (like Vox or the NYT) are basically professional liars and propagandists."

"58","Neglecting perhaps that it is easier to teach a competent data person how to be a journalist than it is to teach a  journalist how to do data analysis? 

Any data person in the academic community, for example, is used to writing papers and sourcing their work.  Some fraction of these have that investigative instinct and whatever else it takes. 

But then are the NYTimes desperately trying to avoid admitting that some unreasonable amount of what happens is shameless access journalism and really nothing to do with ruthless, tenacious and  neutral analysis of the all data available from whatever sources on the subject at hand?"

I asked how we didn't know it wasn't the other way around, that consumers who were less likely to churn also were willing to pay more, and that as you raised price you scared away more churn-likely consumers.. a few blanks stares later and it devolved into me explaining to the fellow the whole causation vs correlation fallacy in statistics."

"71","I've decided the only people who put actual value on coursera (or website of choice) certs are people who have never done them. You can basically turn your brain off, half-ass it, then get the cert.

I'm of the opinion it's better to ask to see a few projects they've done. Even if they're just personal side projects, it's still better than some online certificate from courses of varying rigor and use."
"72","It's true that many days scientists aren't particularly knowledgeable about statistics. However, I've started to see more and more job postings for statistically literate people, especially people with knowledge of causal inference (what I believe to be the next hot thing in data science/analytics)."

"77","Judea Pearl would agree with your opinion. He wrote a whole book on that issue."
"78","Yes, Pearl and his do-calculus is one of the theoretical frameworks related to causal inference. The NeymanRubinHolland model with potential outcomes is another. Moreover, at my old university they were studying some sort of hybrid framework that would combine graphs and potential outcomes via so-called ""node splitting""."

However, it seems like others are trying to combine causal graphs with potential outcomessee for instance: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331670633_A_Potential_Outcomes_Calculus_for_Identifying_Conditional_Path-Specific_Effects.

More specifically, node splitting is at least discussed here, but I can't say if their approach is similar: https://youtu.be/NpNTfvbE1gY."
"81","Thomas Richardson and Jamie Robins, Single World Intervention Graphs. Theres probably some YouTube videos on it."
"82","Have worked with a guy who got in the top 5% in multiple Kaggle competitions. He was self-taught, haven't heard about t-test, and had very vague ideas about causation. Still helped us to develop a complex data pipeline, designed a couple of models still used in production, and finally got poached by a competitor.

In my experience, having a good statistical foundation helps, but it is not mandatory, especially if your task is to provide predictions, not inferences."
"83","Honestly I think this entire discussion is about prediction vs inference. As you said, statistical background isnt a total necessity when tasks only consist of prediction. Who cares about q-q plots when all thats being built is black box models?"
"84","I guess the issue arises when management/outsiders start to conflate prediction with inference. I recently helped out with a clinical research project where the the lab interpreted lasso selection as an oracle for finding the true ""important"" predictors. It was difficult to explain to them the lack of any statistical guarantees of the variable selection, especially given that we had *p &gt; n*.

I've heard many data scientists say that communicating the results is a huge part of the job, and I think it's at least important to be able to address the inferential limitations of predictive black box models."
"85","Check out some papers by Chernozhukov and Belloni on Lasso. They show that in a p&gt;n setting you can get causal inference by doing something called double-selection in Lasso."
"86","And isn't anything above linear/logistic regression essential a black box? 
It's my opinion that if you need a complex model be it tree based or deep learning, then your data simply is very complex and you can't make any simple conclusions from it that you can directly implement in real-world."
"87","And this is why in bioinformatics (and biology in general), we always have to go validate our results in the lab. The discussion is always, ""Yeah, cool, so you found 10 major driver genes... Did any of them actually work though?""

It's a pretty interesting debate we have, because sometimes good statistics just doesn't work in the lab, whereas some, not *bad*, but, less than ideal, statistics finds ""real"" hits."
"88","Forgive my ignorance but isn't inference important when doing predictions? I'd love to hear where this breaks down as I'm not knowledgable enough about statistics."
"89","To my understanding... The difference is the *focus*.

Inference is more concerned with the ""why"" and digging into the relationships between things.

Like finding the extent to which age affects the probability of someone not defaulting on a loan.

Inference is useful for decision support. Like... ""Variable A is the main reason why we lose customers. So let's target that to reduce churn"".

Whereas prediction is a ""proof is in the pudding"" focus. Even though prediction is built upon inferential statistics.

So the focus would be in accurately predicting who will default on loans rather than the ""why"" behind each particular variable.

However... with the credibility and explainability crisis I expect that a greater focus will be on the why questions in the near future. More and more regulation will be in place forcing data scientists to explain how and why their algorithm made its decision. 

So I think in the future, the simple and models with explainable outcomes will tend to triumph for most business use cases. Those algorithms will stand up to audits and would facilitate things like a customers right to know why they were denied a loan.

This may not be a 100% accurate explanation, but according to Cunninghams Law... if its not then we will know soon."
"90","As you said, often times the two are intertwined, interpretibility is huge area of research for a reason. You need to explain why you made a prediction, and inherent to that is some implicit causality.

I don't think it means that nn and tree models are going away, but understanding how to interpret models correctly is part of the prediction skill set imo."
"91","I suppose this is exactly why DS folks shouldn't de-emphasize inferential statistics."

"97","It can matter if you want to know the best levers you need to pull to improve the prediction (in context of the model).

E.g. -- deciding compensation for hiring one more sales persons with background knowledge X results in Y sales."
"98","The thing is, data science is a broad field. Those who have all the skills are extremely rare. The best thing is to get a team that has all the skills and have them work together."
"99","I agree. We also have someone like that and he developed end to end solutions and delivered it to the customers beautifully. A large tech company in SFO area poached him. This person had a very basic stats understanding."
"100","I think it's about the right domain.

Prediction is *wonderful* if fundamental things about the world don't change. Marketing response prediction works great until bad press hits (e.g. Wells Fargo). It's enormously difficult to pivot from reduced form models (typical builds for prediction) to structural models needed to disentangle deep parameters -- and even those aren't fool proof!"
"101","This discussion is as old as data science and it's very close to discussions in CS about 'real programmers'. I will tell you something as someone, who worked in data science for several years: statistical theory in data science is pretty overrated. It's not that you don't need it, but what you describe is not a lack of understanding math, it's a lack of common sense and domain understanding. 

Data Science at the university is research oriented and in the industry it's pretty rare, that you are able to dive deep into methodologies. Usually understanding your domain is much more important. Furthermore, visualization and storytelling are the most important skills as a data scientist in advanced analytics. The truth is, that data science is not different to other roles. In the end it does not matter if much if your findings are 100% correct as long, they look impressive to your stakeholders and just work. 

When we look at predictive analytics, it gets even more interesting. People build models, which predict the cause of a feature or include data leakage and promote the huge accuracy model as breakthrough, without being skeptical. You dont need a deep understanding of stats, to understand that it does not give you much benefit to use these predictions. In the end the model will just not work.

The good thing is, all these wrong assuptions and results are usually discovered later on (A/B tests, KPIs, whatever) and you learn from it. I doubt that statistical theory helps you to avoid all these mistakes in a **time-efficient** way."
"102","&gt;but what you describe is not a lack of understanding math, it's a lack of common sense and domain understanding.

But when you put it this way, I guess I'm being foolish to wait until I'm completely ready to be data scientist.

"116","You're missing something fundamental here. If people were just looking for a simple answer to a question then very likely they would Google the question and get the answer. in the context of Reddit that means they would search the Reddit threads and get the answer

However, in this and many other subreddits people are looking to have a discussion. They're looking to explore the issue, discuss the complexities in general and perhaps how it may relate to their specific situation.

You state that the discussion might not have any merit unless something new is brought to the table. how would you know if something new is brought to the table unless you have the discussion?

It's my experience that most often you do not find valuable, previously unknown ideas just coming out of the woodwork completely formed and ready to go. In my professional life these sorts of rare and valuable original solutions or perspectives come from discussion amongst peers and colleagues. How could we ever do that if we limited our topics to things that were not already discussed previously.

Ultimately, Reddit isn't stack exchange. It's a forum for discussion, a place that people talk about things. I talked about a lot of things before that doesn't necessarily mean that I don't enjoy or benefit from having a discussion with someone new."
"117","Considering how a significant portion of our community is people trying to break into the field, I think it's healthy to have a periodic reminder that statistical expertise needs to be a part of the professional expectations for the role. Further, I think the data science community is overdue to come up with new language to differentiate what we used to call a data scientist, and the ""data analyst *plus*"" qualification that has been lowering the bar."
"118","Yeah, unfortunately when people want to get perspectives on something on Reddit, their impulse is to post first rather than search first. 

(Or people *do* search first, read relevant comment threads, still want to make their own thread on the topic, but opt against referencing all the existing perspectives they've just read? Seems unlikely, but it is a possibility)"
"119","I can't remember where I read it, but it was basically the same thing you said.  It applied to 'big data.'  Basically, the gripe was that there was a lot of data, but the necessary assumptions about the data and analysis often aren't being examined leading to heavily biased results and spurious correlations. 

My problem with 'data science' in general is that there is no real definition of what constitutes a data scientist as opposed to a statistician.   This can be seen in the various curriculums being offered for data science and the job postings out there."
"120","I know what youre talking about, but dont forget that data science is extremely broad and somewhat ill defined. 

You appear to be talking more about inference than straight-up prediction, which can be two different animals. 

The thing I see missing from the data scientists I work with is the *science* part. Theyre great coders and they understand the math and the parts to get models to work, but they dont seem to grasp the scientific process, which is as important as the modeling."
"121","What are they missing in terms of scientific process though?"
"122","Websters Dictionary defines science as...lol just kidding. 

Science is the systematic study of a topic. To systematically study something you need to structure your ideas into hypotheses, formally test them, and document everything. Science is reproducible research. 

The teams Ive worked with dont do this. It is a foreign idea for them to document things that dont work or produce desired results (i.e., *negative results*). However, knowing what doesnt work is often as important as knowing what does work. 

It is an ongoing battle to get them to simply document everything they do, which makes replicating their results impossible.

In predictive analytics you don't really care about what the coefficient mean, as long as it ""works."" Much more mathematical.

While causal inference relies more heavily on domain knowledge IMO and you ONLY care about the coeffiecients.

One is about Y_hat and the other is about beta_hat.

Also, at least for business data, adding in a ""few controls"" isn't any more robust. You need to control for **everything** to have causal inference, usually by some type of experimental design."
"125","&gt; While causal inference relies more heavily on domain knowledge IMO and you ONLY care about the coeffiecients.

Eh... sort of? Depends on the domain. Causal inference is closer to diff-in-diff, and isn't the only use for descriptive modeling.

E.g. credit risk scoring *requires* descriptive reasons for rejecting a credit score."
"126","I would argue diff and diff is causal inference, when experimenting is impossible.

I guess maybe moreso, arguing that you only care about some coefficients. In my econometrics class, our diff-in-diff was a regression coefficient."
"127","Yep! The techniques behind D-D aren't insane. An experiment is basically a D-D by its nature -- due to random assignment, the initial diff is approximately 0. D-D is definitely a *part* of causal inference, not the sum-total. Apologies for lacking clarity."
"128","One of the small number of ""most important# things I have learned in my 20s is that there are,very very very few people that actually know what they are doing. This goes for all ""experts"" across all fields.  It just seems to be this snowball effect of human nature where people to want to look up to someone as an expert, while at the same time people getting literally high from the praise.  What results is a bunch of people who think politicians, scientists, doctors, etc.. Are these anti-human superhero geniuses who are immune to criticism outside of their field.  And this happens on the micro level to.  Pretty much all of the typical heroes the MSM and school systems like to prop up were horribly flawed in reality.  

So ya. This obviously ia happening in ""data science"".  Theres too mich breadth and not enough depth.  I'm an expert in 1.5 things. Goalkeeping for sure and Food Service Operations in a general customer service operational standards sense. It took me being a literal genius and about a decade of experience in both to accomplish that.  Once you really know something well for the first time, you realize how hard it is to do and how few people have ever achieved this.  Probably 1 or 2 out of 100 ""data scientists"" really know what they are doing.  Probably a few more than that are experts in some subset of the field.

Specifically though, my Masters in Data Analytics from WGU focused quite a bit on statistics.  They didnt require you to memorize it, and I certainly didn't, but it exposed it the statistixs to me three different times in three different ways.  I know enough to know how much I dont know in the field, and what I would need to figure out to accomplish some sort of meaningful model. 

That all being said, the whole field is dangerous.  So many managers and users of this data don't want it done correctly.  They dont want to pay for the resources to produce something that, if done correctly, likely will tell them they might be on to something but probably need to spend more money to get a definitive answer if its possible at all.  They just want to be able to pretend to be using the new trend for vanity reasons, or they just want to pay someone to tell them how good of a job they are doing and how their current projects are supposed to result in better financial performance.. Regardless of the actual truth behind it.. Which is that in reality its almost impossible to do this with accuracy.  I say that meaning with how projects tend to be aligned.  Obviously in theory, and sometimws in practice, you can define the question narrow enough with solid enough underlying data to draw meaningful conclusions. Its just extremely rare."

"131","Originally ""data science"" in the industry became popular as a discipline for more predictive applications in which causal inference doesn't play a big role, and was previously dominated by classical statisticians using SAS. CS/Engineering folks got an edge by just using python, xgboost and modern development practices, especially in tech companies.

&amp;#x200B;

Following this success and all the buzz, corporations started to hire the same type of people to do all data stuff that was previously dominated by analysts using Excel (these guys are falling for these statistical fallacies for ages, the only difference is that their methods are shallow enough to management with some business feeling to call BS on them) - including applications where causal inference is central. Not only that, many corporations just started to rename whatever they called their Excel analysts with ""data scientists"" to attract employees.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, technological buzzwords won't solve causal inference - in fact they could lead to more BS vendors going undetected and I'm afraid that the movement in overall with harm more than benefit society in the short term."
"132","I think that there are many types of Data Scientists and many types of jobs/companies. In some places deep statistical analysis is necessary, in others it isn't required.

&amp;#x200B;

In essence this is a question: is data science/ machine learning a glorified statistics or not?

Or: is causal relationships or quality of predictions ? (as many people in this thread already said)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm biased and think that the quality of predictions is much more important for business.

* It is true that you could design a great experiment and make a study of variables, you could look for multicollinearity, run statistical tests and do other things. It would work and be really important in some cases. But if we talk about practice, it is much easier to train gradient boosting model, which doesn't require such assumptions as linear models.
* Sometimes people say that gradient boosting models are black boxes and can't be understood. I disagree - there a lot of tools and technics to do this like LIME, ELI5, SHAP, partial dependency plots and other things. Of course they don't reveal causal relationship between variables and target... but they show how changes in the variable will influence the target which is good enough.
* Also clever technics can replace old tools at least in terms of efficiency. For example it is important to check that the distribution of variables in training data is similar to their distribution in the new data. We could run statistical tests to compare distributions... or we could use adversarial validation.
* And all of this was about ""research"" stages of the projects. When we talk about putting models in production, it is much more important to write good code and pipeline, make a reproducible machine learning project. In companies with developed infrastructure the models would make predictions automatically, their performance would be monitored, if there are signs of model deterioration, then the models would be automatically retrained;
* Also I suppose this discussion is more relevant to classification and regression models. What about recommendation systems? Graph networks? Deep learning on texts and images?

Nevertheless I agree that it is necessary to have at least some knowledge of statistics and common sense. I saw cases when people made serious mistakes due to the lack of critical thinking. But this is more about critical thinking than statistics."
"133","I work with Data Science since 2015, this profile is very common unfortunately. When I started to work on Data Science it was on the field of Natural Language Processing and I have a really brief knowledge of statistics.

Now, after some years, I have more background on probability&amp;statistics theory, as I completed the course of Probability&amp;statistics and Stochastics Processes on the college (Computer Engineering course).

But even more common than that it's data scientist that cannot build software, but only jupyter notebooks. In my view is not a worse problem than not know anything of the theory behind, but well... programming in data science is a serious skill too.

As you said, there is more interesting in making the models seems pretty than correct in the analysis view, but I would said that remains the same at software engineering architecture.

For all that reason, I think building a culture behind Data Science is very important. This year I created a Project Template to help on that."
"134","As an aspiring data scientist, this is something I know I am lacking in.

What would you recommend someone like me, who is trying to improve their understanding of statistics, do? Are there any good online sources, or should I just grab a few books and drill down?"
"135","I'm gonna be frank with you: statistics is a difficult subject, and it takes some time and effort to learn it, so while there are some online sources to learn particular concepts, I really think that you would benefit from a book that offers a more structured approach to the topic.

Regarding a good book for learning some statistics, it depends to an extent on what field you want to work, but for the basics I think that it shouldn't make that much of a difference. It depends on what math background you have, but if it is low ( or non existent), I found the book ""Statistics for Business and Economics"" by Newbold et al quite easy and aprocheable when I took my first course in statistics, and it should include most basic topics of probability theory and some regression.

 In adittion, if you are interested in regression analysis you can't go wrong with introductory econometrics by Wooldridge, one of the most useful books I have ever used, quite comprehensive and easy"
"136","I'm a BS Economics student and Wooldridge is indeed a great book to learn linear regression and panel data (longitudinal for statisticians). For time series I think the best book would be Gujarati. For some reason I got some difficult with Wooldridge approach.

By the way, I took my econometrics classes almost a year ago, I remember the theory quite well, but the proves like how to get the estimation of the betas in linear regression using matrices approach is one example I don't remember. Do you think this is important to know or I'm good remember just theory?"
"137","Depends what you plan to do. If you wanna go into academia  is something quite important to know. If you are going to the private sector to a work that is mostly applied stats or econometrics tohugh, I don't think knowing proofs by heart is that valuable. Knowing the intuition of the concepts and what that proof is supossed to show should be more than enough (at least if you are not on a really technical position, but you need a PHD for those anyway)"
"138","Which Gujarati book are you referring to? Basic Econometrics?"
"139","Yes. That one."
"140","Personally , I would recommend  Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data
By Wooldridge. 

This a little more advanced text but it help to really understand the model . I find his introduction book not enough too understands the key concept and this book talk about other regression type than just OLS ."
"141","A second opinion, but if you're focused on predictive analytics and more ""CS"" applications of data science (NLP type stuff or deep learning), I don't think learning causal inferences is useful for you, beyond knowing what your models DON'T do."
"142","I've worked for 40 years now (not in data science), having graduated in Comp. Sci. in 1978, and agree with many of the comments here - especially that very few people really know what they're doing. Real experts understand that and tend to be the most modest people you will meet -- unlike bullshitters. As someone said, the more you know, the more you realise what you don't know.

A good data scientist really needs it all - excellent software development skills, good stats knowledge, good data skills, good inter-personal skills and domain expertise -- which is almost impossible.

I'd like to add something about programming. People who are not trained in software development generally write bad code. There are exceptions (both ways - I've seen Comp. Sci. graduates who can't program) but, generally, you can tell the educated programmer from the rest. Really good programming skills are often under-valued in debates about what makes a good data scientist."
"143","As a decent programmer, the recruiters have funneled me into a career as a data engineer, instead of data scientist.

These companies really believe a data scientist's programming skills don't need to be any greater than the ability to run scripts in Jupyter notebooks."
"144","They're wrong to think that. But, on the bright side, doing data engineering for a while will help you in the long run because you will gain insights into data science that the people who take shortcuts will never have."

Oh, I'd love to hear from the great to the worst. Could you share your experience please?"
"146","It jumps out of the code when you see a good (trained) and bad (untrained) programmer. There is an art and science of programming that is immediately apparent when you look at their code. It's relatively easy to get code to ""work"" but the elegance and efficiency (and maintainablity) of the code is something else. Also, untrained programmers really can't produce complex code. Their bad practices even confuse themselves when they try to do something clever with code."
"147","Hi. I noticed that you said that people not trained in software development generally write bad code. I am in my second year of an undergrad degree in Mathematics, so I'm not being taught software development in school. Do you have any recommendations as to how I can acquire good software development skills? Are there any textbooks or other resources that you have in mind?"
"148","Can you do a class in Comp. Sci.? A programming class, taught by a computer scientist? There is a science and art of programming that is really only appreciated by specialists. It's been so long since I studied computer programming that I don't know of any contemporary resources. But I would advise being taught by a specialist and not a self-taught person.

Many scientists (statisticians, physicists, etc.) are self-taught programmers and their coding skills are poor."
"149","I agree with you, most of the information I find focuses on the pipeline, but stays away from the stats. 

I'm not sure of the stats of hiring but I imagine that people who don't know what they are actually doing are not the average hire."
"150","I even work with someone who is like this.   
She makes really great figures, but she doesn't understand the machinery behind the algorithms she uses or how they should be interpreted.  
It's too easy to pick an algorithm, generate a pretty picture and use it justify your ends."
"151","I am really trying to know how would that work. Like any algorithm we pick must be based upon what we are trying to achieve. isn't it? 

For example:
So let's say there is a huge n available p is also small and we let's say don't have care about interpretation of data but just want to predict an outcome. 

Now in that case wouldn't linear regression would be bad. A more flexible approach would produce much better predictors. So how could she decide which algo to use? I am having really hard time picturing the scenario.

And what if the variables are correlated. How do someone with no stats account for that?"
"152","Throw XGBoost at it, I imagine."
"153","More or less this, yeah. You can infinitely divide the real number line."
"154","I know this isn't the place to rant but here's something related to what you said. A friend of mine and myself graduated with PhDs in a biology field in 2017. I had already moved into a more computational subfield and had taken graduate statistical analysis courses. By the time I graduated I had about the equivalent of a masters level training in stats based on the projects I'd participated in (based on other statistician friend's evaluation).

Well jump to one year later and my friend is asking for advice about how to learn more stats. I give them some resources and next thing I know see they have finished a data science ""boot camp"" (whatever the fuck that even means) and now their LinkedIn says Firstname Lastname, Data Scientist. Holy shit, they know absolutely nothing about stats and got hired by an insurance company for their data science lead. Meanwhile, I've finished my postdoc and can't find a job in tech for the better part of 15 months. Now, as if to taunt me, I see their LinkedIn posts as they updates their progress on basic level R and Python online courses, ""Yeah! Just finished the ggplot course. Yeah! Just learned how to do linear regression! #DataScientist""

It makes my blood boil.

All these people flooding the industry with no knowledge or experience whatsoever and it's affecting the hiring of people like me who genuinely know what their talking about and are trying to make the transition to industry. I realize not all boot camps are alike and not all students are alike but this has to stop. Most companies are figuring out now that ""data scientist"" is an essentially meaninglessness term that will eventually be broken down into coherent jobs over the next decade. But in the mean time, data science will continue to be an utterly empty term that has become the new buzzword for marketing departments."

"163","DS could actually use a lot more gatekeeping precisely because of what your friend did.

&amp;#x200B;

Far, far too many people entering who never learned proper stats. Maybe I'm bitter because I sat through a bunch of lin. algebra based stats courses in grad school and then did a few years of field work before I started doing anything remotely like 'data science'. I also taught myself the theory behind ML methods rather than just learn how to import a pre-trained model and every time I hear how ""AI"" is magic and we are going to ""get the low hanging fruit with an MVP!"" it honestly makes me want to quit my job and go be a monk somewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I actually am employed with 'data scientist' as my title and I feel I'm fairly compensated but it took a long time. Not a bootcamp + a short internship. And I don't even think I'm really that good! I'm p. jealous of some of my coworker's knowledge. Thankfully the boot camp types tend to bomb out of interviews where I work just given the nature of the questions and who's typically asking them.

&amp;#x200B;

If I had to make an analogy, I feel like ""Data Science"" as a degree and doubly the bootcamps are like putting someone in a wood shop with every tool you can imagine, and teaching them how to use each tool one by one. And at the end, expecting them to be able to build an armoire even though you never taught them how to actually make anything, you just taught them how to use a saw."
"164","&gt;What I realized is that most of this programs do not actually provide  the necessary tools for doing a correct statistical analysis. They focus  on visual presentation of results and some coding (which don't get me  wrong, is quite important), but they do not teach what you actually need  to do a good project: statistical theory ( and maybe some maths to  understand the insides of the processes, but if all they do is of an  applied nature, I think this is more of secondary importance).

&amp;#x200B;

I think some of the reason for that is we have very successful kinds of models with very underdeveloped statistical theory. Successful gradient boosting algorithms are essentially simple algorithms with lots of clever engineering and heuristics. There's not a good theoretical understanding of why neural networks are able to generalize well. At the same time there's a lot of practical stuff to learn before you can use these models successfully. So people naturally focus on getting to the point where they can produce good results, which doesn't require a lot of theory.


&gt;As a result, I have seen projects which , even if they are very pretty  to look at, show a lack of understanding of some basic  ideas of  statistics, such as running an OLS regression with no or few controls in  a non-experimental setting and claiming to have found a causal  relationship between the variables.



This is not new. Before data science there were lots of highly paid professionals making bad inferences from OLS regression. The situation is probably better now that there are easily accessible communities like reddit and stackexchange where people can be told not to do that."

I think this is a critical factor that actually creates a very meaningful differentiation across different ""subareas"" of data science:

If you work for a company whose core offering isn't data science driven (e.g., not tech, not software), then data science is a secondary/auxiliary tool, and the primary philosophical you may have as a data scientist become nonsense to the key decision makers - all that matters to them is outcomes. 

Example: if you work for sales and you come up with a shitty model that is rife with statistical no-nos, but that model increases sales by 10% and is ready right now, there is no amount of statistical naysaying that is going to prevent that model from getting used unless you can come up with a model that increases sales by more.

And the issue is that sales is one of like 4 functions that both exist in virtually every company *and* are frequently the key decision makers in the company (i would argue that marketing, finance and supply chain are the other 3). So the majority of data scientists are going to be working in environments where statistical correctness is like a tertiary conocern at best."
"166","&gt;Example: if you work for sales and you come up with a shitty model that is rife with statistical no-nos, but that model increases sales by 10% and is ready right now, there is no amount of statistical naysaying that is going to prevent that model from getting used unless you can come up with a model that increases sales by more.

I mean, that's the entire point of this thread. It might not even be true that the model increases sales by 10%how do you know that it does if the modeling procedure and experimental design is rife with statistical errors?"
"167","Because, at this point, it is cheaper to run an A/B test than it is to critically design and review an experiment."
"168","You can't A/B test everything."
"169","Don't get me wrong, I think you're right in that there needs to be *some* statistical backing to making statements such as ""sales increased by 10%"".

I think there are two issues:

**In a lot of cases, the time/effort/cost of setting up an experimental design that would allow you to conclusively make that statement is prohibitive.**

Example: I worked on a project where we were testing the impact that a pricing initiative would have. We were asked to look at both the impact on margins and the impact on volume. Simple enough.

The problem is that there were so many moving variables that it was virtually impossible to control for the right variables and maintain a meaningful sample given that we were restricted to a specific geographic region for testing. If we wanted to get a clean read on the impact of the project, we would have needed to control for salesperson, customer type, purchase type, purchase frequency, assortment, specific item, channel - just to name a few. More importantly, we only had like 200 customers to work with. 

This is all on top of the fact that we worked in an industry that relied on about 15-20 other commodity markets, all of which were liable to fluctuate and impact both sales - and definitely margins. 

When you really got down to it, there were more moving parts to this project than we could reasonably control for. Which meant that no matter what type of experimental design we came up with, odds were that we were going to get an inconclusive answer.

So that's half of the equation: you literally may not be able to get a clean answer without spending a ton of time  testing - and because of the speed at which business and business innovation happens, if someone thinks the idea is good in principle and seems promising at a high level, no one is going to stand in the way of it. And that is because...

**The risk associated with rolling something out which has already been developed is normally low**

Let's say you ran some high level numbers and you find that you grew sales by 10%. You know in your statistical heart that it is really 10% +- 15%, and there are about 10 factors that could caveat that growth. But all in all, you tested the model in reality, you saw 10% growth based on some sort of simple test/control design, and the results look more positive than negative. Not good enough to bet your life that they are sustainable, but good enough to bet someone lunch that they are.

You roll out the program and it turns out that when you expand it to the full set of customers, that +10% you saw before become -1%. You find out in rolling it out that there were issues that didn't impact the initial set of customers that are a problem now. Or maybe some of the efforts required of your workforce don't scale as well. Or maybe you just got lucky during testing.

Whatever the case may be, *the cost to pivot away from this project and/or improve it to address issues is much lower than the opportunity cost of not going after 10% growth.*

To divide that into two parts:

1. When something doesn't work because of a design flaw, there are almost always process + execution considerations that can be taken in order to address that. It's rare that a concept that held water from a conceptual and testing standpoint cannot be fixed/addressed when it runs into issues.
2. Worst case scenario, you jump ship. You ax the project, take the loss, and move on. And in expectation, you're better off if 50% of the time you hit on a +10% growth project, and 50% of the time you cut your losses and move on to the next project than if you wait to have extensive enough testing to convince yourself that you are 100% going to see growth.

Again, this is not true in every industry - there are industries where, because of the speed and magnitude at which business happens (i.e., high frequency, low magnitude), you are 100% better off setting up a good testing protocol to make sure that whatever you are seeing can be as close to certainty as possible. Example: if you're Amazon and you want to roll out an improvement to your pricing engine, you 100% want to test it to the point where you are 99.99% sure that you will see positive returns, because you have the platform, business model, transaction frequency, low testing risk, high production risk combination that makes it all work out in the favor of good, fundamentally sound statistical testing.

But when you're talking about industries like B2B, with huge transaction values, low transaction frequency, largely offline sales platforms, opaque market conditions, dependencies on maybe multiple commodity markets, loooooong sales cycles, etc., then you're not going to get a nice, clean environment on which you can run such testing.

Having said all of that: I agree with you that even in those cases, it's better for someone to choose the best possible experimental design out of the options available. I have seen, even in those circumstances where there are a lot of ""as right as it's going to be"" options, people who choose the categorically wrong way to evaluate a program."
"170","You raise a lot of good points. It's true that there's many moving parts to an analysis or data science solution and that you might be unable to control for everything. But your statistical knowledge is still useful since you were able to identify these problems and eventual weaknesses of the proposed solution(s). 

Someone who just knows how to maximize AUC by any means necessary won't be able to identify these problems and their solution might look good on paper, but could be useless in reality. 

However, I'll concede that the skill set we are talking about isn't purely statistical, it's closer to general data science knowledge/experiencebut sound statistical reasoning is an important part of that skill set."
"171","&gt; Someone who just knows how to maximize AUC by any means necessary won't be able to identify these problems and their solution might look good on paper, but could be useless in reality.

Completely fair. And I have ran into people in my lifetime who presented results to leadership that were so fundamentally flawed that I had to underhandedly shoot down their whole project by escalating up my chain of command."
"172","Almost halfway through a master's degree in Data Science. Can confirm. Also, you should do a video series on how to do data science properly."
"173","Problem is you're gonna get people watching that video and then calling themselves data scientists, that's the world we live in now"
"174","My experience is that nowadays there are many people looking for becoming a ""data scientist"" (sounds catchy, right?) without wanting to learn the basics as math and stats. We all how businesses work: people want to  have some sort or tittle? Let's sale it. They take some coursera courses, some datacamp workshop and now they feel they have became a data scientist. 
Now, have you count how many online courses/YouTube videos / blogs are about data science? How they all promise to teach you? Funny is that many of them copy from each other, reproducing mistakes and of course, omitting all the proper statistical basics, all the theory. It's all really applied, no deep theory, no sustain.
It's becoming really hard to take serious the label of data scientist. I don't really know what to expect from them."
"175","Companies : ""Maybe if we get PHDs theyll be better?!?!"" How about you understand what the fuck the thing is that youre employing people for. Do most data scientists even understand what the generalization of a standard linear regression is?"
"176","Can confirm. From a consulting and data provider firm. 

I am astonished at the clear lack of understanding of basic foundations of creating quality datasets with sound methodologies and then presenting said data to an audience. 

They feel because they know the subject matter of which the data represents, that they know the data. I find this laughable because to me it's not really about what you're trying to analyse (like footballs), but how you do it and the underpinning ""science"" behind the data.

I raised this point in objection to the placing of a particular person on a data platform creation project only to be shot down because ""they know the subject matter and you don't.""

Welp. Good luck to them. It's been almost 9 months and they don't have a product. All they had to do was properly staff the project but I guess nepotism and cronyism is more NB!"

"178","I agree with all you said. Proper statistical and probability thinking is something we screen for when hiring. People will have different background and training; having a weaker statistical background can be ok if one realizes its a blind spot and seeks peers to ensure their work is done properly.

There are a lot of ways to fail and the most dangerous ones are these logic/statistical errors as they dont throw an error at you when you do them."
"179","I think it just depends on job scope, if your goal is to build software that makes predictions, little to no stats is required but visualization, programming are critical. If your designing experiments, then coding isnt necessarily as critical. Ultimately if the math someone is using isnt sound, the results will speak for themselves, event to nontechnical people"
"180","In my experience, when people learn to use basics in a few Python libraries (ex. pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn,...) they start to call themselves data scientist. And this is because of all DS courses online (there are some really good ones, but most of them is there just to be sold), which is growing industry. Now, 90% of people think that DS is Python or R and some visualizatons. The other problem is that the companies don't know much more about DS too, and we have a perfect environment for those who can sell sh** and get away with it."
"181","Machine learning is basically p-hacking to imply causality which does not really have to exist (not literally, but this is the result).

I have a PhD in Neuroscience and when I tell fellow Scientists that I am a data scientist now, they know what I mean and that it is not real science.

"185","You see, it's these kind of data wizards that believe now suddenly it is scientific. 

It's not. 

Usually your data is not retrieved in a controlled clean manner. On top of that, many data scientist ""clean"" their data sets to facilitate machine learning, which by itself is not scientific. You must have a very valid reason to remove even outliers. Removing data is highly frowned upon when doing data analysis. There is a word for it: fishing. 

You will get ""real world"" data without having had any control on any potential influences. 

When you find any sort of statistical connection between one variable and the other and it is actually causal, you were just lucky. Sure, the math shows it is ""causal"" in your data but that does not mean it is in the real world. 

It is not a mathematical problem, I am sure you know your maths/data wrangling, it is a methodological problem with the majority of data ""science""."
"186","&gt; You will get ""real world"" data without having had any control on any potential influences.

Im not a seasoned practitioner, but I feel like most data sets of interest dont give you any control. Most phenomena dont occur in an experimental setting or with any ability to control for things explicitly. I work in auto insurance. Its pretty hard to experiment with accident claims or fraud detection. To me thats kind of the fun of it. It doesnt mean I cant use statistics to better understand whats going on.

More generally, I feel like people have these stories they use to explain phenomena that the data is derived from. These stories are pretty simple and sometimes theres data that contradict them. The science part is seeing how the data matches with peoples informal stories and hypotheses. But theres a domain-specific art to creating new hypothesesnew storiesabout how the world works that better explain the data and what we see."

Code can be taught. Give me someone with a stats background and a humble approach."
"198","Not even close.

Having a working knowledge of distributed systems, writing efficient/clean code and building production systems will trump any nerd with a stats background. Most stats knowledge is abstracted anyways, read a stats 101 intro book and you're good."
"199","So is there a basic agreed upon list of what someone should know before they can call themselves a data scientist? If not can we crowdsource one here?"
"200","So is ""data science"" just ""statistics lite"""
"201","Not really fam"
"202","you're joking right?  of course. completely, each and every day.

&amp;#x200B;

"203","Two things in this post: First, data vis of Star Wars' performance on Facebook and Twitter. We got the data from the APIs and visualized it using Crowdbabble (you could also use D3 for free, if you don't mind some JavaScript coding). Second, embedding those visualizations within Sway, Microsoft's new presentation tool.

Having tried it out, I think Sway could be useful to the data scientists + visualizers here, because it's fully responsive. Rather than trapping your work in PowerPoint, and making it pretty impossible to see on mobile without a lot of zooming and pinching, you might consider Sway. They're both made by Microsoft, but Sway seems to be a lot better suited to mobile and other screen sizes. "
"204","Hey Man!
That's super cool and I can help with my Eldrazi Tron Deck and prepare a Form. 

Greetings"
"205","Eldrazi Tron form and spreadsheet created, just needs players to enter their data now :)"
"206","I just noticed that the Etron form, only has card #1 listed"
"207","Thanks, fixed!"
"208","Fantastic!!

Would you consider adding UB (Dimir) Mill?"
"209","Will do!  I'll be on a trip this weekend, leaving here soon, but will make it as soon as I get back."
"210","Sure. Enjoy your weekend!

I'm starting to think the best thing would be to create a Google Form and a copy of the spreadsheet. But I'll catch up with you when youre back.

Stay safe."
"211","I wanted to maintain a bus commute as both stops are closer to my work/home. Three times this week, I've taken the metro or an uber instead because the next bus was listed as ""schedule data"" -- which means it might come late or not at all -- or it wasn't coming for FORTY MINUTES.  On a main route.  I'm not standing in 27 degree temperature for 40 minutes to help beta-test Metro's tracker system."
"212","Yeah, bus operations/data quality definitely needs work. It's not uncommon for [\~15% of scheduled bus trips to be missing from WMATA's real-time data during weekday morning rush](https://twitter.com/dcmetrohero/status/1214584753355141120), for example. Hopefully this is something Metro and the region takes more seriously soon given [this subject is touched upon in the actions plans of the Bus Transformation Project](https://twitter.com/jamespizzurro/status/1215339818143617024), but we'll see."
"213","Who are you who are so wise in the way of science?

Seriously though, do you work in transportation, or is this just a hobby?"
"214","Lead Developer of [MetroHero](https://dcmetrohero.com) here. It's just a hobby. A really, uh, annoying hobby where you get to learn all the things wrong with transit data and operational challenges at agencies like WMATA, but can't do a whole lot about it. ="
"215","[Here is another example](https://ibb.co/1zn0G3B). Its 7 pm in Chinatown and there isnt a bus for 45 minutes. I often walk 2 miles home from work because it's faster than the bus."
"216","Buses get stuck in traffic and seem to attract more crazies than the metro. Have had numerous buses not show up at all or pass the stop completely. The drivers often are unprofessional. And a metro plus walking or uber can get you almost anywhere here without the previous mentioned annoyances."
"217","The Metro doesn't have to deal with traffic *shrug*"
"218","And the stations are warm!"
"219","I may be in the minority here, but I actually enjoy the Metrobus system. It's useful and fills in a lot of gaps that the rail system doesn't cover, and as long as BusETA is accurate (and not using ""schedule data"", which I hate because that's always bad news), it's pretty much accurate."
"220","I enjoy it when there is a bus running relatively close to my departure time. I just hate opening my bus app to see no scheduled buses or a bus in 30+ minutes."
"221","I only use the schedule if I'm leaving a station. If I'm headed to a station then use a tracking app like DC Metro Transit. Once in a blue moon there's a ghost bus but it's pretty spot on."
"222","[removed]"
"223","I mean, why pay $10 for an Uber when you can just hire a private driver to drive you everywhere. The car would be nicer and the driving would be better.

For real though, your scenario costs $16/day more. That's nearly $4,000 more per year on your commute. Most people don't have $4,000 to blow just on getting to/from work a little faster."
"224","Wow can't wait for r/washingtonDC to tell me why everything is bad and wrong about public transportation! Surely they won't whine about poor people and talk about how great Uber is!"
"225","What are you talking about? Anytime someone comes here to say something to the effect that cars are better than transit they get downvoted."
"226","Do you have the rest of your ducks in a row on your ABM strategy - good data, handoff processes and workflow between teams? 

I think intent data is good, a lot of people are relying on Bombora data. You may be better served with a sourcing + intent tool - than just an intent tool. 

I feel like ABM has been used as a buzzword for a bunch of software categories - and an excuse to charge more for unnecessary tools. I think self-reflection is really critical - and understanding where your process gaps are before buying new tools."
"227","This really helped my marketing team and I gut check. We don't have the right attribution tools in place, and decided to take that route. Bombora will be great once we have something for attribution and lead scoring in place. thank you!"
"228","You are welcome! Good luck! We are figuring this out now too. :)

Im on the marketing side and have spent a lot of time in operations."
"229","i work for a huge company and we spend so much money on bombora its useless. 


get a good marketing automation tool that you can wedge abm into. hubspot, marketo, pardot. or pay for a marketing attribution tool like bizible or terminus. 


quality abm and cheap usually dont mix AND are useless without the people who can execute properly"
"230","We're absolutely going the attribution route now. Marketing has been plagued with blind spots, so we need to start there to really understand our visitor behavior. I appreciate the thoughtful reply. We're getting a tool that offers attribution+automation+some intent data."
"231","whats your stack rn? salesforce and some entry tier MA? 


bizible is amazing for tracking your paid ad spend. marketing automation tools can sort of track paid ads but really are good for tracking activity and data from things sent out by them- not the paid ads piece. 


good luck!"
"232","just sent you a DM"
"233","I'm familiar with the offerings from Bombora and TechTarget, but not RollWorks. 

Is RollWorks leveraging bidstream intent?"
"234","No they use Bombora, Dun &amp; Bradstreet and their own data."
"235","We started using Bombora (through ZoomInfo) and the data seems accurate.  Considering we are in the beginning stages of our Intent campaign I don't have a ton of feedback yet, so look forward to hearing what others think as well."
"236","Do you happen to know how much bombora costs? What kind of intent data does it provide?"
"237","ZoomInfo for 5 users was around $33k/year and I believe the Bombora piece was $15k out of that for 12 topics (AWS, Azure, GCP, Cloud Management, CASB, Cloud Migration, etc).  I think it would be useful for specific products, but as of right now our topics are pretty much topics every organizations is or should be thinking about so I'm not sure how valuable it'll be for us."
"238","We went with RollWorks since they use Bombora and Dunn and Bradstreet. Our ICP is very, very specific so I'm looking forward to any additional visibility I can get. I'll chat you in a few months and we can compare notes."

"241","Bombora: We were quoted $17.5 for 25 topics and an additional $5k for linkedin integration."
"242","Big Data is a universe of problems that are mostly caused by size. Understand the universe of problems first. Then you can better understand how the different tools address these problems. First rule of Big Data: each tool solves a different problem and usually in a different way.

All the tools are good. None of the tools are good at everything. Tool selection begins with understanding what problems you have to solve and then finding the right tools for those problems. Spark and Cassandra might exist in the Big Data Universe, but they do very different things to solve very different problems with large data sets.

Here's a common problem with Big Data: aggregation.  If you need to add the values in one column in 100 rows of data to get a sales total for the week, any old relational database can do that nearly instantaneously. If you need to add the values in 100,000,000,000 rows, your query might not finish in a relational database before it's time to run the next week's total.

Columnar databases solve this by storing a column's values in the same data block. This is really cool. In row based storage, a single data block might have 100 rows. In columnar databases. A single row is spread across as many data blocks as there are columns in that table. If s single data block can hold 100,000 values for a single column, then adding up 100 billion values only requires 1 million I/Os to fetch all the data into memory so it can be added together. If you do the same sum on a row based table where a data block only holds 100 rows, that requires 1 billion I/Os to fetch all the data, most of which you have to throw away because you're not interested in it.

This is a really powerful way to support aggregation reports on Big Data sets. However, you cannot use it very well to find a single row. That row is scattered across (say) 50 data blocks, one for each of 50 columns in the row. Instead of an index pointing you to a single data block to retrieve a single row, it now fetches 50 data blocks. No fun.

Key idea: storage management is key to performance in large data sets.

Every Big Data tool has its trade offs. I think it will be easiest if you browse the google results for ""big data tools"" and start to internalize which problems each tool is designed to address. This will eventually arm you with a really good set of questions to ask about any tool that moves or stores data.  

Provider specific tools vs. generic tools is maybe a misleading concept. The trade offs in my experience are always workload related, meaning my workload as an engineer. Spinning up a VM running Linux in anyone's cloud gives your a place to run any tool you want, but that means installing, patching, configuring, and managing that tool. Spinning up the vendor's preconfigured tool offloads a lot of that work onto the vendor's automation, giving you more time to do your business-specific enhancements to the system. 

The good example of this would be Glue in AWS. It's built on top of Spark and is an ETL tool that is billed by cpu usage. There is no licensed ETL tool that can compete with Glue's cost. There is no home grown tool running on a VM (EC2 instance) that will be cheaper.

What are your goals in studying Big Data tools?"
"243","I don't have a goal or specific data right now. I am interested in all stages: storage, processing and analytics. 

Could you recommend a few promising/good tools provided by the three providers  for me to read more about?"
"244","I work within AWS cloud. Look at S3 and glacier. Look at Elastic Search and DynamoDB. Redshift. For relational databases, look at Aurora clusters for MySQL and Postgresql. 

Don't know why I didn't think of this earlier: watch the videos from the 2019 re:invent conference.  That will give you a great overview. Then snoop around for similar conferences from MS and Oracle."
"245","Databricks (only offered managed by Azure last time I checked) is really nice.

Ive used AWS Kinesis a bit and that whole ecosystem is really easy to work with."
"246","Do you mean Apache Spark, by Databricks that is only offered by Azure?

Does AWS also offer Spark?"
"247","Databricks is a notebook-style editor for working with Spark.

It is open source so you could build and host it yourself, but Azure offers it as a managed service."
"248","What is a service being ""managed"" and not being ""managed""?"
"249","Managed usually refers to a cloud provider hosting an application for you.

You could spin up EC2 servers and download the Databricks open source project, build it, and run it. Then youd need to have scripts in place to restart it if it crashes, and manage network permissions so it can access data.

Or, you can pay Azure for their managed Databricks offering, where they do all the above for you.

Other examples:

Any database offering

AWS Elasticsearch

GCP DataFlow"
"250","AWS is still the standard.  Azure is preferred by large companies with extensive Microsoft contracts/partnerships.  No one uses Google Cloud.

When you say ""big data""... do you mean ""large databases"", or do you mean ""hadoop""?"
"251","Uhh.. my company just signed on with GCP. Its pretty great so far."
"252","We are also all in on GCP, have been for about a year. ~50 person IT org, mostly developers.

Im in dev not data but I have no complaints."
"253","I was wondering what the data tech stack is used in your company, i.e. data tools your company is using for storage, processing and analytics?"
"254","We arent doing much around analytics yet, but we use DataFlow, PubSub, Firestore, and BigQuery."
"255","Thanks. Do you have candidates for analytics tools in mind?"
"256","I was wondering what the data tech stack is used in your company, i.e. data tools your company is using for storage, processing and analytics?"
"257","Going through a few POCs now to determine the best route. 

We are storing raw data in google storage (GCP version of aws S3). We load critical reporting data into BigQuery for reporting and analytics. Still deciding on what to use for ETL (dataproc vs dataflow vs data fusion vs custom solution using spark on gke. These services are similar to EMR or AKS in Amazon). 

A lot depends on your companies needs and resources. If you are strapped for resources, managed services such as gcp BigQuery/aws redshift, gcp cloud sql/aws rds, etc maybe the way to go. If you have the resources, it might be more efficient in the long run to build out a data platform on top of kubernetes.

All three providers have pros and cons, and all three can help your team build highly effective data pipelines. I highly recommend having a deep understanding of the tools and services you plan to use before diving in. Jumping into big data in the cloud unprepared can lead to enormous costs and challenges. Try to take your time and get it done correctly and as future-proof as possible."
"258","Well yeah, so much available capacity!"
"259","I was always under the impression that google firebase and big query were popular services."
"260","Google has one of the biggest databases when it comes to Big Data. Saying that nobody uses shows how incompetent you are.

All Google products use analytics. Google analytics is what makes YouTube profitable. Google does mine a lot of data as well, but it is widely used in the market when it comes to AI and analytics.

BigTable, BigQuery, are widely used in the GCP world.

I think companies are just behind when it comes to bigdata."
"261","&gt; BigTable, BigQuery, are widely used in the GCP world.

Widely used in the GCP World... and what a little world it is."
"262","Tools related to big data, including storage (databases, distributed file systems), processing and analytics. Can be generic (existing outside the cloud providers) or specific to cloud providers. Popular or promising not falling out of favor or being replaced."
"263","hmm so twice as fast spreading as swine flu and 2-3 times as deadly"
"264","Swine didn't stop growing, I personally don't know why right now

But yes, in terms of speed relative to what the nCov has reached in numbers thus far, yes.

The r0 and death% tells a different story though."
"265","Your title is misleading. It's as if you were trying to prove that soft skills are more important than hard skills in your hypothesis. The correct way would be to say ""An example of why communication skills matter more than technical skills in certain cases"". Even then, I'd rather say they are complementary to each other."
"266","Agree, I'd go as far as to call them synergistic in the literal sense. The sum of their products is far greater than either on their own. I've always maintained that the best data scientists I've worked with were greatly enabled by their people skills. In my recent role, I worked with two guys: a data analyst that had incredibly impressive technical chops but no people skills, and a data scientist that didn't have as great technical skills (relatively speaking), but felt comfortable getting out there, building relationships, understanding the business, and building domain specific knowledge.

The analyst just couldn't understand why he was having so much trouble getting the data scientist role. He put so much effort into the technical aspect, and was brilliant, but you could not take this guy anywhere. He provided no value if not in front of his computer. He was a bit of an extreme example so don't take it as me inferring that everyone here is socially inept. But you get the point.

I find a lot of us here focus so heavily on learning stats, programming, machine learning, etc. yet we overlook doing some of the things that are actually uncomfortable and not as natural to us. Toastmasters, leadership development, presentations--you don't have to become the best at these things, but man just getting better at them will have a tremendous impact. My opinion anyways."
"267","On the flip side, we had DSwith few tech skills, but could sell ice cream to a person of Inuit decent. He was very capable of explaining quantitiative concepts, and oversold many clients bc he lacked the skills necessary to properly process and analyze the data to know its limitations. He ended up costing the company boatloads of money in not just legal fees (after we got sued by 2 separate clients), but also in lost revenue and the costs incurred by a damaged reputation. Too many experts in pivot tables convince themselves that tech skills are overrated, and that they can be a DS. If you want to succeed, my opinion is that you have to have a healthy tech background coupled with above average presentation abilities, and of course advanced research and statistical acumen. There are no short cuts- at least in the long run."
"268","That's true. You can't edit titles though. I did not think too much about it and wanted to illustrate the fact that you can go a long way with simple tools. 

Obviously you won't cure cancer with beautiful charts."
"269","Redacting skills and at least minor sense of aesthetics is where its at."
"270","I don't think this is an either or thing.

This is like debating which is more important - the gun or the bullet."
"271","Good article and good point for discussion. I agree with the previous comments though, that it isn't appropriate to say communication skills matter more than technical ones, but I do agree they are deeply complementary. Data analysis without communication is pointless."
"272","One more thing which is important is critical thinking, for example not comparing very different things.

You could also say that this guy helped more than NASA, for example.

&amp;#x200B;

(the article is great by the way)"
"273","As far as I know, the NASA has not released any PR about them helping the fight against Coronavirus."
"274","Yes. Because neither NASA, nor Deepmind are about this"
"275","They have tried to tackle the the virus problem with Deepmind (https://www.businessinsider.com/google-deepmind-ai-predictions-coronavirus-2020-3?op=1&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T). 

Your point is fair that even though they are tackling the same problem (Coronavirus), the solution they are providing are very different. 

I don't think that it does not invalidate my point that good communication with simple stats can have greater impact. Obviously there are things that good communication can not solve and that advanced ML can."
"276","It's funny because I thought that same exact thing as I read it Wed. Great point."
"277","Fact is communication skills are a lot easier to hone than technical skills. Technical skills are always more time intensive so that's what everyone focuses on. Not to say that communication doesn't play a huge role. It does. It's just easily overlooked like most soft skills for that reason."
"278","If you stay in the weeds, you'll stay in the weeds.  Communication skills allow you to progress in a career far beyond being the best technically.  Not equating this to happiness but more towards a higher monetary value position.  Unless of course you work for Google and you're part of the million dollar engineer club."
"279","Anyone else on their phone who also thought the graph was a hair on their screen when scrolling down?"
"280","It seems to me like you lack an understanding of tech"
"281","You need a portfolio then and start presenting to get your skills in front of hiring managers locally. 

Basically, youre missing the problem solving and storytelling aspect so pick some problems and show what you can do. Its partly easier to teach those skills than technical skills anyways. Your manager can tell you what to do to start off anyways. 

I hired some like this recently, who did not like getting a beginner offer but its company policy. And it made sense. In a year theyll be up to speed and will warrant a salary increase but the workload right now will be on me as well as them."
"282","Thanks. I figured that would be the way the salary would work. But what should I put in my portfolio? Which problems to pick?"
"283","Pick something of interest to you. If you're feeling adventurous find something related to the company you're interviewing/applying with. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, applying for health care, show something related to population health data - where in the county is worse or better? Or a basic visualization?

For Finance? Show something related to the analysis of stock or market data depending on the role. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ideally you do not want to use a data set that's everywhere, such as Iris, cars or titanic."
"284","Thanks. Yeah, I did Titanic just to learn. But I can start to pick stuff that is a bit more interesting and eye-catching."
"285","Keep working on your programming skills. If you know some python already then focus on pandas. I use pandas for every single data science project that I'm working on. Then from there, start learning the machine learning techniques. Then do a couple personal projects or kaggle competitions to apply the things you've learned.

"286","Thanks! I did the Titanic kaggle, both using linear regression as well as a neural network. I'll continue with the pandas, they seem very useful."
"287","If you're having trouble and you don't have a grad degree, two good paths are to first get an internship or first get a job as a data analyst."
"288","I'm already interning for company now as data scientist in Tunisia, but I got this job because of referrals not because of my experience and I aim to find a DS job in Europe. Do you think its feasible to find an internship or to land a data analyst  in my case?"
"289","Great, you're on a good track then. I think it is, but I'm in the US so I don't know  about the European job market."
"290","Im in Europe and its feasable, at least the internship. It depends on the market. Here in Northern Europe the DS market is a little saturated, lots of companies went all in and got Data Scientists and have now realized they dont have the infrastructure in place to support them so are buying up Data Engineers like mad."
"291","hey it's a good start ! Now you should focus on getting as much experience and knowledge from this internship

if you're not too low on money and hardworker I also recommend to take a few month gap for personal projects !"
"292","An employment gap on a resume is always questionable"
"293","is it really if you have never worked as an employee but as an intern ? I don't know I'm a student too !"
"294","If you are in school during that gap, no. But any time there is time on a resume where you aren't employed that isn't explained on the resume, it could be a concern for some."
"295","That's a shame since personal projects are usually the most instructive and the most interesting for employers : it really shows how someone's able to work with self-government and ones ability to imagine and think on his own. Although I feel like personal projects don't belong in the CV (but rather in an interview)

Thanks for your advices"
"296","What if you are having trouble *AND also* have a grad degree. I have both biostat and BME degrees and will be graduating spring witb an MS

I am still having lot of trouble and I have never had an internship or job before. Most internships in this field wont take me bc I am graduating


I wonder if its because my software eng skills are weak"
"297","That's normal too. Getting the first job is supposed to be the hardest. I can only speak for US, but I graduated with my MS in Physics and didn't get a job straight out of it. I ended up doing a (low paying) internship in the summer, which I got partially from the help of a reference. I started looking again in July, applied to 100 jobs, interviewed, and landed my job in October. Again, my ability to get an interview was largely dictated by whether I had a reference (5/100 apps got me interviews, in 4 had a reference).

As for having a software engineering background, I'm sure experience there is really helpful. If you lack there it may help to work on some projects and put them on GitHub? Your background is solid, I'm sure you can make it if you keep pushing."
"298","Do projects, build a portfolio, have a body of work that can demonstrate your skills in lieu of experience"
"299","There are three key areas of knowledge of an effective data scientist (defined as someone who analyses data and codes models): programming, math (stats for most businesses), and business itself. Considering many in data science come from CS / STEM backgrounds, often one only hears about the former two - and it is great if the company has data science at the core of its business model. Unfortunately, most businesses do not. In order to identify problems and create applied solutions, business understanding is essential. Hence my answer would be that unless you go to work for a company that already has an established and internally valued data science team (where you can learn about the business on the job), do not start as a data scientist.  For other careers, pick a business that you like, pick good management, and possibly even a place where technology is underappreciated. Why? You will e.g. write an easy predictive model for product sales, and you'll become a star."
"300","Seems like an interesting tip, thanks man !"
"301","Good luck!"
"302","Depends on your background. If you have a PhD in physics, id go directly for data scientist. If you have a bachelor's in international affairs, I'd try to get a job as a database developer or data analyst first"
"303","In my case, I'm a CS major, I've done couple of internships (a ds internship that I'm still enrolling in as a part of my degree and a web dev internship)."
"304","If you can get a ML Eng job, that is a really good path."
"305","I agree with this. Demonstrating that you can write big boy code, can build sensible data pipelines, and understand how to integrate common ML algorithms should honestly be starting work for every data scientist. So many I've worked with just copy/paste SVM or whatever, put up a nice confusion matrix, and call it a day. Digging into the parameters or scaling the work to a large data set causes blank stares. In short, ""data scientist"" is a watered down job title, imo, so differentiate yourself with engineering work. My other advice is to be a lifelong learner. Best of luck to you."
"306","&gt;  In short, ""data scientist"" is a watered down job title, imo

Data Scientist can mean 2 things:

""Advanced Business Analyst"" or ML Engineer

There's a totally different domain out there under the Data Engineer job title that overlaps with ML Engineer. Just my opinion of course."
"307","++ for life long learner"
"308","Agreed. I'm a fairly high profile data scientist for one of the biggest companies in the world and there is plenty space on the stage. It'd be much easier to climb the engineering ladder to the top compared to the software side. Primary comparison is that the best systems engineers AREN'T systems engineers. They come with some background. A BS/MS in systems... Even systems engineers with PhDs are laughed right into middle management and will go no where from that point on. That's where data science is going. It's not there yet but the better data scientist understand the data first."
"309","I don't know much about the DS job market outside of the US, but I would go ahead and try for a DS job. If it doesn't work out try for a analyst role"
"310","Okay thanks for the tips!"
"311","What if you are a bachelor in physical affairs?

*10,000 tomatoes unleashed*"
"312","What do you mean by the If you have a PhD in physics go directly to data scientist sentence ?"
"313","Data science jobs are very competitive. Ideally you would have data science work experience. If not, you still need something to differentiate yourself at the resume stage. An advanced degree in a quantitative field might do that."
"314","Tips for getting a data analyst job? I have a BS in applied stats and know R, Python, SQL and even base SAS. However I've been applying to many data analyst and similar jobs without any luck."
"315","What's your location?"
"316","California"
"317","It's a numbers game for the first job. Just apply to as many as you can. Go to networking events."
"318","Create some projects and place them on a github repository, then include it in your CV/cover letter. That'll put you ahead of most candidates with no experience."
"319","You lack experience in industry where data science is used . Being an analyst is a more reasonable job position for a new bachelor level grad without experience 

You are missing business knowledge - that is the most valuable thing that sets data scientists apart when it comes to landing a position .

A 1 year analyst in oil and gas industry is a better candidate for a data science position in an oil and gas company than someone off the street.

Apply to any data analytical and DS parallel positions to gain business knowledge and move into a formal DS role 

- this is just my opinion -"
"320","Do you know for certain your preference is on the analytics side?  You can also try for an MLE job instead of DS, depending on what you would enjoy.

The job path, if not jumping into the desired role initially, is: analyst -&gt; data scientist or software engineer -&gt; machine learning engineer.

Though, there are always exceptions.  I went from SE to DS many years ago.  This requires luck more than anything imho because companies do not hire DSs who have previously worked as an SE.  You need an internal project at a company that lets you transfer teams usually."
"321","And what is the highest paying job among these all ?"
"322","What kind of pay?  In happiness and not hating your life?

In cash, MLE, as they're usually needed at large companies.  They say DS pays more than SE but out here in the sf/bay area I often find SEs being paid equal and sometimes above DSs.  MLE, DS, and SE all are paid a similar rate.  Analyst is the exception and can be paid 1/2 to 1/3rd of the other titles."
"323","Hahaaha, but which career you'd hate yourself the most in since you mentioned that"
"324","I did a gig as a software engineer and hated it.  I learned and grew a lot!  I stopped being self conscious about my programming skills.  Today I'd easily qualify as a senior or principal software engineer if I wanted, which is pretty rare on the DS side of things.

I find the opposite is true for many people and they like being an SE better.  Some people just like building things and some people like discovering unseen patterns in datasets.  Some like both.

I can tell you on the MLE side, PyTorch is well received but if you want to work at Google you'll need to know Tensorflow.

You'll find what you like by doing hobby projects.  That and classes.  Eg, MIT has a data science 101 class you can take and see if you like.  Though, I find projects to be a better indicator."
"325","Why not just farm out your resume to all data related jobs and make a decision on who bites? Data analyst, data engineer, data scientist, reporting analyst..etc"
"326","Can you elaborate, I don't understand?"
"327","Submit your resume to 100 companies see who bites"
"328","Or in some cases *9000!!!*"
"329","the motto I've lived by is "" you get what you go for"", Its worked out well so far."
"330","Vicky Boykin, a respected Data Scientist in our field, has written an exact blog post for your question. I encourage you to read it:

http://veekaybee.github.io/2019/02/13/data-science-is-different/"
"331","Thoroughly enjoyed reading it :) Good advice for junior data scientists."
"332","Is it possible for a psychology graduate to start a job as a data scientist, or perhaps relevant occupation ?"
"333","Depends. Where are you based?

If your psychology education was anything like in Europe (at a university) you would have extensive experience with:

- Setting up research (questions)
- Conducting experiments (experimental design) and which features could measure which outcomes.
- Thinking about data gathering and analysis
- Interpreting numbers and graphs related to statistical analysis
- Decent stats knowledge. (I.e. you've had the basics relating to ANOVA/LinReg/LogReg/PCA. Best case scenario: CFA/EFA/SEM. Between/within group ANOVA's (can be compared to clustering). Model selection/model evaluation/feature selection. (Even though most of psychological statistics is very classical, knowledge of the above makes transitioning to ""Machine Learning"" very easy, especially since ML/AI is just a fucking buzzword.
- Problem solving skills related to the above.
- Scientific philosophy and critical thinking.

Then apart from the above you would probably need to be comfortable with some form of programming language (Python/R/SQL), and basics of machine learning experimental design (train-test split, etc).

Since Data Science is a very ill-defined term (broadly speaking) you could have more luck at less technologically advanced companies. You might consider them less prestigious, but honestly who cares if it gets your foot in the door.

Do notice that most of the people commenting on reddit concerning requirements for data science are from a very STEM heavy background or CS background. This makes their advice most of the time ill-suited for most businesses that want analysts/scientists (in a lot of companies analysts do the same work as data scientists, just under a different title.) Those comments would most likely focus on things like ""you need linear algebra, calculus, optimization, discrete math and w/e"". Let's face it, at most companies you won't use that straight away. There are so many companies which are not at a decent ""data maturity level"".

Advice: get a junior position somewhere with an established team so you can get domain knowledge. At the end of the day if you know a lot of maths but cant deliver business value, your boss is not going to like you. And delivering business value is a lot harder considering you have to speak to stakeholders who don't know their nose from their ass when it comes to what they want to know."
"334","Thanks for your reply, in Malaysia we do have research method and analysis subject for every semester as my campus follow the UK syllabus, I did learn about the basics (anova, linear regression etc) and learned to analyse data using SPSS, but I believe my understanding is still at a shallow level.. 

As for R, Python Ive been learning on coursera to develop some basics skills and get a professional certificates, however idk if its recognised by organisations. 

Basically you are right, getting my foot in the door is the first step and local organisations often prioritise CS, AS and CE students, so right now Im focussing on online courses hope it will help with my application."
"335","I dont understand what you mean by more logical. If you want to be a data scientist, pursuing data science positions is the most direct path to that."
"336","Most of the data science jobs I found require data analytics, big data, sql .. job experience. I got the impression that it is hard to get a DS job without an experience ( I am a CS major).  So I thought maybe its smarter to gain work experience with fields that compliments data science first, then apply for DS position with more qualifications."
"337","Youll see listings that want experience, graduate degrees, etc. its not unheard of (or uncommon) to take an entry-level position as a data analyst before pivoting to full DS. Just get as close as you can to what you want and fine tune from there."
"338","Okay, thank you!"
"339","If you see skills on every job posting youre looking at then get that experience. You might not have a job to cite but you can always work on a project and put it on github and a medium post. 

And if you dont know SQL then go learn it. Its fairly easy and I wouldnt bring in anyone, even a beginner data analyst, without some proof they could use it. Also, go learn Excel. Spreadsheets are a much more powerful tool than they get credit for."
"340","I already have a good base in CS, databases, big data, python .. Currently I'm learning ML and DL and the math, I'm working on projects in that field that I'm going to put on github as well.

When companies say they need work experience in a technology they do not mean that someone hired you to use it, they mean that you've done project using it? Is that what you mean? Thanks!"
"341","Just following up because I didnt see you specifically address it, are you experienced in SQL? Ill echo the parent comment that its absolutely a necessity in my experience (having hired several intern positions and entry level positions in data science and analytics for my company)."
"342","Yeah yeah, in the CS degree we studied databases quite deeply (mysql and oracle), and I've applied what I learnt in several projects of mine"
"343","Job descriptions are boilerplate. Asking for job experience is standard. Having said that, theres a difference between understanding from a class and understanding from experience, especially when it comes to doing real deep analysis. A lot of data science is now very engineering heavy where you dont need as much analytical skill to understand the problem as you do technical skill to optimize a model but much more is still focused on having the skill set to take an abstract, incomplete, and bug-ridden data set and returning actionable insights. That last skill is hard to get in school and an independent non-academic project is one way of signaling that you have that skill."
"344","Yeah I kinda get that, I am working on improving myself on that part. But there's not much resources addressing that ( cleaning messy data ). I'm already interning in a local company in a DS role, they gave me a database with 3 millions rows and they are asking me to build a model that predicts sales of each product for the next year, and I can say that the data is messy and there is a lot of errors, missing data and stuff like that, but I didn't find many resources on how to correct that."
"345","That's amazing training. You'll learn the truth about data science: 80%+ of the effort isn't in model selection or fancy analysis, its in understanding and cleaning your data. Its frustrating and can make you hate yourself or your chosen profession at time but its incredibly important.

When I interview people, one of the question I often ask is how they'd approach a bug-laden data set. By the end of your internship you'd be qualified to provide an answer, which is something a lot of your peers who won't get a similar experience won't have. Good luck, its gonna suck sometimes."
"346","Well yeah probably hahaha, but do you have any good resources on learning to do that effectively ? And btw, thanks for the tips :D !"
"347","With data cleaning, the best way to learn is to do. I don't actually know some resources but googling missing, corrupted, incomplete, buggy, etc. data should get some good starting points. Then, as you encounter issues in your internship check the internet for similar things."
"348","Dude, your internship experience will be quite valuable, you just have to present it well in your resume, making sure to highlight whatever you've learnt. I'm in a similar situation like you (CS undergrad, graduating in 2020) and I've been applying to a lot of companies asking for ML engineers, and I think that's the best way to start a career in DS. Gaining experience in the field in whatever way is possible. 

And talking about missing data, see if any of the basic pandas  techniques work for you (assuming you use python)."
"349","And how is that working for you, did any of the companies respond ?"
"350","Not really, but I'm hopeful. I already have a job in one of my country's biggest IT companies, where I currently intern, but I can't be sure if I'll get an AI/ML related role when I join full-time later this year. I also applied to one of Omdena's challenges, for experience. They help you learn a lot in Data Science, and you get experience working on a real world project."
"351","Best of luck man, hopefully you'll get the job you are looking for!"
"352","I may offer another insight: when deciding between offers you should simply choose the company with the better fit for you. Even if you don't work as DS, you will still gain experience and also money and also networking and also change your living situation etc. It's a great start anyway."
"353","Hi, Yes I think this would be possible. I would recommend starting of as a backend engineer and then moving into specializations like ML engineer or Full stack engineer depending on your interests. 

For the back end engineer the basic requirements would be:

1. Algorithms and data structures (I recommend getting enough practice from leetcode, etc they have learning paths which can be very helpful) This is usually where most engineers fail in the interview

2. General understanding of web systems, like what is a front end? what is a back end? how do they communicate with each other?, since you have experience with Python I would recommend looking at flask its easier to get started on

3. Understanding databases, like SQL CRUD queries, joins, views, OLTP data modelling

4. Docker, most companies currently use docker for their apps 

5. Optional: kafka, OLAP database (AWS redshift, etc) not all companies use this but would be good to know what these are

hope this helps. Please let me know if you need more specifics. Good luck :)"
"354","Thanks! I guess I hadnt considered a switch to back end developer, as its rather a large career jump. I feel like most companies wouldnt want to hire an ex DS PhD, or I would have to take a giant pay cut. I might be totally pulling that out of thin air though! Otherwise I feel like it makes sense as a clean break from DS and gets me right into the thick of software development."
"355","u/doctor_of_space  are right about the paycut you will have to take :( . I am not so sure about companies not willing to hire ex DS PhD's as a backend engineer, I have seen a few of these. Another option would be (depending on your ""big data/ spark/ NLP, ML"" expertise) is to look of a ML engineer or Data Engineer I think this might give you the interesting challenges involved in working with large amounts of data, the ability to flex your DS skills and not take a huge pay cut as these positions are usually closer in salary range to DS."
"356","Option 2 is great advice, imo. Your DS qualifications becomes one of your benefits in a role like that."
"357","IMHO, with a PhD you would not want to be a back-end engineer and I think you might be bored. What you really want is to find a place where your capacity and background (math, whatever) are utilized in a way that you can work on algorithm design, proofs of concepts and maybe get into the nitty-gritty of a particular implementation of something interesting. There are jobs in Fintech that match this description, maybe some select DoD work, robotics, blockchain.... Back when I worked in the financial industry, we had a department staffed with PhDs and most of them came from either physics or math. They worked on some super secret trading stuff (stochastic calculus based). The entry into the group wasn't conditioned on knowledge of things like Kafka or Spark or C or Python (those are just tools any monkey can learn) - it was assumed that with an advanced technical degree those would be easy to pick up. However, not any monkey can pick up advanced calculus, complicated geometry etc. etc."
"358","Hmm do you think it would be possible to get considered for these positions with just a bachelor's in electrical engineering?"
"359","I don't think so."
"360","With *only* the degree, probably not.

However, a LOT of computer engineers have electrical engineering degrees. In addition, a lot of electrical engineer jobs involve significant amounts of software development.

As a specific example, Im a computer engineer with both CompE and EE degrees, and I develop CPU simulators, analyze data from them and real systems using data science techniques and tools, as well as build our infrastructure with DevOps tools.

I also know a TON of EEs that decided to switch from hardware to software. They usually made moves after they had 2-5 years experience that included SWE work in their EE job."
"361","lol not a chance."
"362","Damn >#"
"363","I work in finance.  At the firm I'm at (a very large hedge fund you've definitely heard of), and at one of the previous firms I was at (similar), we would sometimes/often hire science PhDs for coding positions.   So-called ""quant devs"".  Guys who can code but also know math.  It's really (really) hard to hire people who know how to code very well but also know math well, so we pay them handsomely.

There's definitely a very lucrative market for those types of folks.  You probably don't need any additional formal education.  Just learn to code well - python and C++.   Especially C++.    Science phd + solid C++ skills == unicorn status.   No need for more school.  Just learn C++ really well and spend a lot of time on LeetCode (as much as you can stand and then some).  

I'm actually trying to hire someone like this now and it's proving to be a huge pain in the ass despite the fact that we pay through the nose."
"364","For such quant jobs, how can one gain the necessary skills after graduating with a MS in some computational program without doing a full PhD?"
"365","you mean to be a quant dev, or a researcher?  i'll assume you mean QD.  in that case, just study C++ so you know the language pretty well (understanding how memory management works, including types of pointers, or how objects are initialized, virtual functions, how templates work, etc) , but also knowing algorithms, which isn't really a C++ issue, just an algorithms issue.   for the former, just read C++ books and practice coding.  for the latter, spend a lot of time on LeetCode.  it wouldn't hurt to know linux reasonably well too.  nobody really programs on windows in finance - it's 99% linux.

when you go to apply, make sure ""knows C++ and algorithms"" is featured prominently in the description in some form or other.   also, list all the math courses, ML libraries or whatever else relevant you know.  make sure it's obvious you know some math, even if you're not a hardcore researcher.   

there's no secret to it - just know your stuff.  reading. (e.g., C++ primer, 5th edition), practice projects and LeetCode."
"366","Thanks for the tips!"
"367","A coworker of mine is almost done transitioning into a SWE role. Here is her gradual progression 

Data scientist -&gt; data engineer -&gt; 
ML engineer -&gt; SWE

So she went from modeling based DS role to a spark heavy DE role. From there she was able to deploy models to the stack as a ML eng. And after building enough experience there the switch to SWE was possible.

Not the only road from A-&gt;B but it worked out for her"
"368","This is definitely an approach I have thought about, albeit mostly just DS -&gt; DE -&gt; SWE, so skipping the MLE side. Definitely an issue I see arising is the amount of technical work for me decreasing, however. This is mostly due to a strong push for people in my current company to take on leadership roles as well as my strong communication skills. Unfortunately I dont really enjoy that and would much rather be doing technical work. Perhaps trying to switch over more to a DE role would be a good idea then."
"369","Same. I was an officer in the navy. I absolute hate being in situations where youre accountable for technical details on 10-15 projects at a time but your only access to it is at the 10k foot level. Seemingly, no question was off limits and you never felt comfortable with your knowledge.

I much prefer to be hands on making technical/design decisions and not just memorizing superficial details to appease upper management."
"370","Dang that last part sums up my position at the moment. As much as I love getting hands on in the projects and presenting them, its a mine field that takes almost as much effort to traverse sometimes"
"371","If you dont want an emphasis on leading and communicating, Start telling people to go f*** themselves and stuff, it worked for me and now Im nice as can be!"
"372","I'd be curious what pushed her from ML engineer -&gt; SWE.  Any chance you could put me in touch?"
"373","Good lord you shouldn't have to go back to school to do software development/engineering.

You should be able to self-study your way into a position.

Brush up heavily on data structures and algorithms. You will probably find this one of the more enjoyable areas, but I could be wrong. It's my personal favorite area of CS. Unfortunately, in the real world, you don't really mess too much with these in a hands-on way. You'll usually implement something that already exists, although there are plenty of edge cases where more custom-made stuff is used. And of course, knowing WHAT to implement, even if it exists already, is as important as being able to make custom stuff.

Also brush up heavily on design patterns. These are usually well-understood and efficient design patterns used in production environments. They generally are used because they either represent a ""best practice"", are easily handled by teams of people working in a project at the same time, or both.

Databases. I suspect you have some familiarity with them as a DS person, but maybe not. If not, SQL time."
"374","To second this opinion, I also found learning to implement classic data structures helpful."
"375","It very much depends on what you would want to do with CS since there are a plethora of avenues you could go down. Each one varies but the core concepts are universal. But as for c/c++ and python those are highly in demand everywhere. Fortran not so much to my knowledge. C/C++ tends toward embedded development and python towards research, in ML DS and many other fields. It all depends what you want to do, weather it be research or software development. Web dev in and of itself has front end and back end development that varies. There is also just writing test code for other projects too. So definitely slowly dive into things and see what you like, each has it's own downsides and upsides."
"376","Web development is the most boring thing ever so be careful."
"377","I know lol my researching ml stuff rn and plan to do that indefinitely"
"378","stay strong man you can do it"
"379","&gt;I understand that those skills probably not what would be in demand

C++ and Python will get you very far. 

Instead of doing another degree, why not do some self study on computer science topics where you find your knowledge lacking?

Compilers, operating systems, database systems, computer architecture, numerical analysis, formal logic systems, etc. would be a good start. Just look up the coursework from MIT's OCW and that should keep you busy for a while.

Is there any particular professional stream that you want to enter into? Are you going for a role in industry or in academia? What kind of problems interest you?

I would also find some open source software projects and learn how to contribute to a community with a codebase that you want to advance using technologies that you want to work with for tools that solve problems that interest you."
"380","These are good suggestions, thanks. I honestly dont know what role Im thinking of, it was a big enough change to end up in DS that I havent considered that. Definitely industry of some kind though. I like your comment about the open source contributions, Ill give that some thought!"
"381","Something that you can start doing is taking on more and more engineering tasks -- deploying the models, setting up APIs, getting your hands dirty with infra tooling. 

While these can sound daunting and even boring tasks, you'll soon find out that there are plenty of problems at the intersection of DS and engineering that don't have great out of the box solutions, or even remotely well-established practices. To name a few, low-latency model serving, model life-cycle management, model monitoring, data drift detection, etc. are fairly interesting topics that you could start exploring and forming an expertise around. 

Given your background, getting hired to work in interesting problems won't be an issue. Just poke around your organisation (or hell, even open-source) for unmet needs that require engineering solutions and you'll surely find plenty of stimulation work that goes beyond just doing classic web/CRUD development. 

Be prepared for leetcode style interviews though!"
"382","Data engineer for sure. It's a good blend between skills you have and skills you want. Transitioning from there to full blown dev is pretty straightforward. 

I've worked in data (not completely DS) for about 7 years. I'm slowly moving towards full-stack development and devops.

I wouldn't worry about taking much of a pay cut or finding employment. You have the framework already."
"383","I am somewhat in the same boat with you. I am ""forced"" into making a switch from DS to SWE due to the needs in my company. Simply more Software development work is required than analytical work at the stage our company is in.

While SWE work is quite fun, it is just sad to see DS skill which we have built for months wasted away."
"384","Your company does not own you :-)"
"385","Try applying at FANG. Your CV seems interesting for them. Practice coding interview  and you will be fine."
"386","Youre a PhD. Take a couple coursera courses and watch some YouTube videos. Get a job, learn, and move on. The less school the better for CS."
"387","I respectfully disagree that less school is ""better"". I taught my self programming, and then entered a university program, and then kept teaching myself while working at different positions. The self-teaching and the formal coursework are both useful in complementary ways. That said, going back to school probably isn't necessary for many people who are already working. (One of my colleagues never finished his undergraduate degree, and is a quality software engineer.)"
"388","I would agree at lower levels, but when youve gone to 9 years of secondary and post secondary school, id say your ability to learn is adequate to teach yourself what you need to learn without adding debt. 

I went to 2 semesters of a 6 semester masters degree and dropped out. I learned the rest of what I needed on the job. 

(Edit) felt like I needed to clarify. I took interviews after my first semester with stuff fresh in my mind and got an offer and then dropped out. Wasnt a case of Im too good for this more of a case of new employer did not pay for masters, old one did.

You will learn how to learn CS in a degree. CS today is less algos and data structures and more reading documentation and stitching APIs and Libraries together. I would say OP is more than capable of reading documentation and applying it after completing a PhD."
"389","hahaha.

I am almost done a Neuroscience PhD (recording and analyzing signals from the brains of behaving rats), so I can't disagree with you about evidence of learning how to learn. (Research funding pays for education.)

Learning new stuff that somehow falls under the broad umbrella of ""information processing"" (biological or engineered) is a short summary of my overall educational and professional history.

Our CS courses involved building classic data structures as classes in C++ and then essentially implementing a spreadsheet like program with our classes underneath MFC GUI interfaces. Then we had to learn things like digital logic design, build a small microprocessor, program it, write a function in assembly to boost performance in a C class, implementing a buffer overflow attack, higher level computer architecture, building threaded classes, discrete math, mucking around in the Linux operating system components to perform various tasks and re-implementing classic artificial intelligence designs. I wouldn't have learned a comprehensive picture of the systems from top to bottom without the whole package."
"390","I suggest you have a chat with people in the field who are working in industries from CS background. It seems obvious to follow interest and hence ask for reaource and courses. Not saying it is wrong but perhaps its not a good option as we all have bias. Write your questions down from this post and start to research people from friends, or people you dont know.write them nice emails. ask for contacts. 

more interview, better clear picture you can get.

I'm similar to your but not holding Phd. I'm applying for MS CS. Before applying, I keep asking myself that do I really need one?  

Initially, I have researched for a long time on web dev coding bootcamp and can confirm the nature of commercialization make them skip the core understanding of CS. By that mean, do you want to become chef or just cook?  Dont get me wrong. Coding bootcamp has their place but I dont want to say 'they didnt teach me' , when my boss asks me to do sth or I am going to solve my business problem.

I've talked one coach and I've not asked for my friends. I'll do this gradually."
"391","Ive actually been interested in the same or similar transition since last year and started to take undergrad CS courses at a local university. I dont think you need to do the same but I did find that I was able to learn topics like Data Structures more easily in a classroom environment."
"392","I'm in the middle of making this same transition.  I started the OMSCS program to help facilitate.  I think my first step out will probably be something like a data engineer.  Thugh I'd love to leap straight to SWE I just don't think it's doable."
"393","I totally agree with your path. Either that or MLE if possible, get enough experience there and then make the full switch."
"394","You could become an Applied Scientist at a FAANG. Great pay.  


Enter as a Data Scientist if you aren't strong at programming and then transition within a year."
"395","I mean that would be the dream, ideally. One of those or Microsoft or just a big tech in general. I know Microsoft and Amazon sometimes hire where I am, Charlotte, but the location could hurt me, as I cant really move anytime soon."
"396","This is more of a personal request, but for the love of God, learn to write clean, readable code. I've worked with some really brilliant data scientists, much smarter than I'll ever be, but none of them wrote legible code. 

*The Pragmatic Programmer* is a great book on practical coding techniques."
"397","1. Cloud/Infrastructure/DevOps. Depending on your team, I personally have to do all of this. Data infrastructure is sufficiently different enough from application that it's typically self managed by the team. We use Terraform, Packer, Docker, Ansible, Buildkite, Docker etc. 
2. Writing clean and performant code. Analysis is typically a solitary job focusing on a single task at a time, and the code is seldom reusable. Therefore there is little incentive for analysts/DS to care if other people can understand the code, or things like modularity, naming, efficiency, tests. And they are right to not to. But this won't fly in DE.
3. Deep knowledge in the language/DSL(e.g. Spark) itself, rather than just using it as a tool. I can't articulate this very well, as the language is ""just a tool"" for the results you want to achieve everywhere. It's just that when I'm doing machine learning, language is little more than a way to use ML specific libraries. I switched from R to Python just because  Python had certain bindings to frameworks that is much better than R's. When becoming a de, I realised that I didn't understand Python. Things like generators, decorators, multiprocessing, data classes, functional style programming, to name a few."
"398","Imagine a programmer decided he wants to be a chemist and takes an organic chemistry course or two and gets hired to do lab work and is completely clueless about most things. What would you suggest they do?

Learn and do it fast. Formal learning, informal learning, blogs, books, courses, lectures... everything you can lay your hands on."
"399","Some subjects you should understand at a more than casual level:

* caching: know what a cache replacement policy is and why some are better than others and under what circumstances an LRU eviction policy might not be what you want.

* character sets: Yes the world would be a lot simpler if it were all utf-8 but it is not.

* database systems: you should be familiar with resource management in a database system and with how indexing works in your database and how data is represented on disk and in memory in your database. You should be familiar enough with popular database systems that you can get up to speed quickly.

* networking: most of your data is arriving at your system over the internet and is being passed from component to component inside your system by network connections; know what can go wrong and how and where you can apply sanity checks and error correction codes to data in-flight.

* talking to project managers: If someone is asking you for something impossible, how do you educate them? If someone wants an estimate how do you communicate your error-bars? If someone asks you to do something unethical (e.g. take this batch of behavioral data and figure out which ads are most profitably shown to cancer patients ) how do you push back without losing power?"
"400","I would really call this stuff data engineering.  Data engineers usually mess with stuff like Kafka, Debezium, Postgres, and that sort of thing.  Just making sure data is stored properly and surfaced nicely to the right stakeholders.

It varies widely what kind of programming/engineering/tools skills a data scientist needs.  We use AWS, and some of our machine learning engineers use docker, but I'd only vaguely heard of cron jobs before.  On the other hand, I know a surprising amount of Ruby.  Just learn the basics of whatever people use that you don't know rather than worrying about what skills are generally useful."
"401","Neither. The ability to convince the hiring manager and stakeholders that you can provide value is what is most important. Really, its the same for all jobs."
"402","I think there's a lot of good to be said about getting practical skills and knowing when and why to apply different Data Science techniques to problems that largely overtake a degree in usefulness assuming that you do actually understand the tools your using.

That being said, I can't see how someone can understand a lot of advanced tools data scientist use without having taken the necessary mathematical and statistical foundation courses.  I'm not saying you need a math degree, but I think in order to really be set on the data science tooling you want to have taken multiple levels of calculus, linear algebra, probability and statistics theory, regression analysis, and having a decent amount of coding.  A lot of this can be self taught to fill in gaps, but to self teach all of that *entirely*? It would be pretty hard in my humble opinion."
"403","You can definitely find a job as working in BI or analytics without any real math knowledge. I have a degree in statistics, and frankly outside of a few very large companies or specialized companies, the mathematical knowledge isn't all that high. I don't think I've ever really used much of my math knowledge on the job..."
"404","Definitely, and I'm quite a fan of traditional analytics and BI as career choices.  However they specified ""data scientist"" in the title, and so my response was really geared towards the role as I would imagine most people think of it, that is, leaning towards more advanced statistical modeling/ML implementation."
"405","I disagree with people who say the degree matters because of what you learn during it.

The degree matters because it's a stamp of approval. It tells a prospective employer ""this person was able to get the grades necessary to graduate from a 4 year program, which tells you that there is a minimum degree of capability that they must have achieved AND tells you they are able to do what is necessary to graduate from a work ethic perspective"".

When you don't have a degree, you need to prove all of those things explicitly. This is why a lot of companies require a degree - it's too much effort to vet out a candidate that doesn't have one unless they have extensive work experience.

So my question for you would be - other than dropping out of college, what else do you have in your resume that tells them you will be a hard working employee? That you will meet deadlines?

Skills are a part of it, but showing that you will be a good employee in the more general sense is important."
"406","degree for sure - its the only way to get a foot in the door."
"407","Skill matters. The degree is valuable because of the skills you develop in doing the degree. You can gain useful skills outside of a degree, but it just so happens that degrees are very popular ways of proving you have some of the skills an employer may be looking for."
"408","Drop out at what stage?  For an MS or PhD, you definitely could if you have the skills, it just might not be a research scientist job at a place like Google.  However, it would get significantly harder if you dropped out at the BS/BA level."
"409","Skill/Experience &gt; Degree. A degree mostly helps with getting through HR filters but IMO this mainly happens at bigger companies. If  you have sufficient skill/experience and proven projects then the degree wont matter much.  
  
It all kinda depends on the company you're applying to and the domain its in. You'll most likely need a degree for a hardcore R&amp;D position but if you're applying to a local startup, a degree wont be as important."
"410","Skills.
R,Python are enough I guess."
"411","I already have certificate in this language, I'm also considering getting a data scientist course, just wondering if Dropouts can get a job?
Thanks for the quick response :)"
"412","Certificates are a dime a dozen these days. Obviously shows you have some understanding but won't be worth much on their own. 

Try make a portfolio of projects on github to showcase your ability to write code."
"413","In my experience there seem to be two tribes of hiring managers. Those who value education above all else and those who value practical skill above all else. You will have zero luck with the former but stand a chance with the latter.

I fall into the latter case so can speak to what I look for... I run a data science group in a large asset manager. Would I consider you with a certificate in data analysis - god no. For that matter though, unless your PhD was very specifically applied I probably wouldnt either. What I want is evidence that you can play at this level. For me that means things like a top 5% Kaggle finish, approved pull requests against a library we use or a good story to tell and quantify.

The key point here though, is if this is something you really want to succeed in, you either need the academics, or some tangible proof of skill.

Edit: toned down the wording a touch."
"414","/r/thathappened"
"415","Suit yourself. It might have come across as arrogant (which i've tried to tone down) but it remains true..."
"416","In my opinion don't focus on frameworks, frameworks come and go, any sufficiently big shop might have their own frameworks or some company uses something you've never heard of.

What's important here is learning to learn. If you know the foundational stuff and you can pick up new frameworks, that's what's interesting from an employability perspective. Companies want to know that they can throw you into whatever they've got and you'll swim.

Pick whatever frameworks you do know, and go deeper. Try to figure out what patterns and tricks they use. If you use more than one then compare them, being able to identify strengths and weaknesses is a key skill required in day to day engineering.

Other than that if you do want to learn something new try a new language. Java, JavaScript, Python are always safe bets and used almost everywhere. New languages can give you a whole new perspective which is much more interesting. For example if you compare the idiomatic approaches to a task in Java and Scala.

Critical thinking is key, it's a bit cliche but it's what people are looking for in interviews, rather than a laundry list of tech stacks"
"417","Really depends on the company. The larger companies that interview almost purely based on whiteboarding and leetcode don't care, but I've found that the smaller, less technical companies do care about the tech stacks you've worked with. They don't have the resources to wait and train a junior for 3+ months so they will throw some stack trivia at you during the interview process."
"418","&gt;it's what people are looking for in interviews, rather than a laundry list of tech stacks    
        
The problem is that people are looking for a laundry list of tech stacks to /get/ to the interview stage, at least it seems like that when I look through job listings for junior dev positions or internships and most of them want ""good skills in &lt;40 different frameworks&gt;"".
   
Thanks for your advice!"
"419","I recently saw this LinkedIn post where the person came across a job listing asking for 10 years Kubernetes experience, Kubernetes has been around since 2014 (at least according to Wikipedia). My point is don't be put off by the requirements. It's just spray and pray. Try to be concrete with your experience in your CV (STAR format can be handy) and then you want to be able to nail the interview.

It seems a bit daunting but a honestly there's a lot of luck involved, so all you can do is keep pushing. Eventually it just works out. There's a lot of us like you that have made it so don't be too worried, (just enough to keep you from falling behind)

Good luck!!"
"420","&gt;  asking for 10 years Kubernetes experience, Kubernetes has been around since 2014 

wait till you see those asking for 10 years of deploying react views on Kubernetes ..."
"421","They'll probably want 10 years of swift experience too."
"422","&gt;asking for 10 years Kubernetes experience, Kubernetes has been around since 2014

Well, it's kinda technically possible, it just means they literally want someone from Google's infrastructure team before k8s got open sourced."
"423","Im in the same boat, all interviews cancelled.  Those job postings used to worry me too because I dont have tons of framework skills from my university (and by that I mean a couple were maybe mentioned in one class one semester).  As much as everyone already says it, really just apply anyway...its how I got any interviews in the first place(and made it passed phone screenings to scheduling in person interviews right before this pandemic hit).  It really does seem that the posting is just a hiring rep that doesnt understand the day to day work and bloats the requirements.  I apply, they ask what Ive done and how what Ive learned could make me successful, then I usually get to speak with manager on the team for at least a phone interview."
"424","No, they're *listing* a laundry list of tech stacks, they aren't expecting you to have experience with all of them. Their perfect candidate would, but rarely do companies actually find their perfect candidate."
"425","I have been using Spring framework for about 14 years. Developed several applications that still run.

Not all frameworks come and go."
"426","Okay nobody else has said this.  **DO NOT LEARN PHP**.  I took three PHP classes in college and absolutely nobody was looking for PHP developers when I graduated and started looking for jobs.  If you know Java or C# then you will be able to carry that over to most other OOP languages."
"427","lol too late, I learned PHP long ago. Luckily I know Java well."
"428","The majority of jobs I see in my area look for Java restful services (things like Spring Boot) and either React or Angular.  If you learn those two things I am pretty sure you will have a good pick at jobs.  I have been wasting my time with Django applications for the last few months and every job I have seen online is asking for three years of experience with Django.  I finally got over the learning curve though so I don't want to stop using it."
"429","How long did it take for you to learn Django? I'm really interested in it but I heard about the learning curve."
"430","I would say about 3 months for spending 15 hours a week after work.  I am at a point where I get how all of the files work together and if I got a job I could work my way around the framework.  I am still by no way proficient in it yet however.  Also like I said I can't find a back-end Django developer job that doesn't require several years of experience."
"431","Communication and networking skills. Spend some time working on a moderately large open source project - one that has a defined development process.

Any competent dev can pick up a new stack in a matter of weeks, it's not a big deal. Focus on bigger picture stuff."
"432","Rather than focusing too many language and frameworks.. learn how to write best code, learn how to solve complex business problems.

There are multi purpose language and frameworks. Choose one that has been on the market for a while and will remain for a while. And be perfect on it. Start a pet project, keep adding as many features to that single project. 

Just because you know English, Japanese, Chinese, French, Spanish and Russian.. that doesn't mean you can write a great novel on either of those language. 
Programming works similar way. It's art. Learn how to be good artist!"
"433","Learn Java/C#/JavaScript/Python. These languages are picked to maximize your chances of getting hired. You can get a job working with any language but these are fairly common and in demand. Learn a frontend framework like React/Angular/Vue, check the state of JavaScript report to see what is going in and out of favor. React is a solid choice and so Vue. Build some projects using whatever language is relevant to you. Build some webapps, they can do whatever but even better if it's for a problem you or someone close to you has.

Getting a job is going to be tough this year. Depends on how fast the economy recovers."
"434","It heavily depends on region and target employers. So a lot of west coast FANG companies use Python. A lot of low and medium COL companies use Microsoft stacks. I do mostly Microsoft and medium COL and the skills we usually look for are.

Web API, Angular, Azure, C#, and Agile.

The skills I've seen as having a lack of food candidates are due to cost of entry in large part...

Cloud and DevOps.

I would recommend getting a cloud cert and OOP for most companies. For FANG leetcode and Python are a good call."
"435","&gt; What else would you recommend?

To the specific end of ""land[ing] a job"", whatever gets the most hits on jobs boards. That's going to vary depending on where specifically you're looking for jobs. Some areas have 90% of the shops using C#, some have 0%. Professionals frequently caution against [resume driven development](http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/10/resume-driven-development.html) but it's a fine strategy for getting ""a job, any job"".

That sort of maximizing tapers off pretty quickly once you get a few years north of the entry level. Employable engineers are good general purpose problem solvers who can navigate common software design patterns, not people who brute forced an understanding of the latest-and-greatest stack."
"436","&gt;but it's a fine strategy for getting ""a job, any job"".   
     
That's definitely what I want right now. I just want to get my foot into SWE professionally.   
    
&gt;who can navigate common software design patterns       
    
Is this even something that I can learn on my own? When I learned about them in my courses, it seemed very theoretical and I don't really know what to do with my knowledge about design patterns."
"437","&gt; Is this even something that I can learn on my own?

Kinda sorta? [Code Complete](https://smile.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670) is a fantastic resource for this stuff. Understanding which patterns to apply and when to apply them takes time and wisdom. It's a puzzle that is heavily influenced by the business requirements of the thing you're building. 

With respect to architectural choices, you're also subject to the team(s) that will be interacting with or depending on your service."
"438","Emotional intelligence"
"439","Not easy to learn alone at home during a pandemic with everything on lockdown :D"
"440","Wait really? How come there are still recruiters reaching out to me"

"445","Look at the job listings in your area, and look for repeated mentions of any languages or frameworks. Pay attention to the types of companies that use certain technologies. For example, here in the U.S., Spring or any Java would be very rare outside of financial industry. Drupal is used by mostly government and large corporate organizations. Laravel, RoR, Django are more common with typical startups. Think about what kind of company you want to work for.

I think that we'll see more stability through a likely recession with more established companies, so even though some of what they use is considered more dated or less hip and fun, there will be more opportunities for people who know somewhat older frameworks and languages. Ruby on Rails and Laravel will always be in demand."
"446","&gt;For example, here in the U.S., Spring or any Java would be very rare outside of financial industry     
     
Interesting. I actually started to learn Spring because that's what I see in many job listings in my area and the financial industry is very strong here."
"447","Java is not rare."
"448","Sounds like you're on the right track!"
"449","I did my PhD using matlab. So.... No."

"457","I agree, coding quality is generally not encouraged as much as papers, but it can depend on your field as well.  If people are doing ML in an applied field and cross discipline (e.g. engineering, physics, biology), and their works winds up as tools/platforms for others, then they usually have decent programming skills."
"458","If it does it's a side effect. A PhD is about doing research."
"459","I'm working with a guy who has a PhD. He is a terrible programmer."
"460","I knew a few who mostly worked with excel during their PhD"
"461","I'm working with a few guys without PhDs. The quality of their code is universally atrocious.

I don't think the ability to write good code correlates with having or not having a phd."
"462","I don't know, I would probably still be writing shitty code if I hadn't worked with a real project where quality code was required. Obviously it's not a rule, but I talked to a friend about it and he said all PhD persons he had worked with wrote shitty code."
"463","Imho, it's more about the willingness to put the effort to write quality code and having the right environment to learn good practices. This is not something that people are born with, you have to put the effort into it.

In a way, this talks more about the company rather than the people. Your colleagues don't write code in a vacuum, they write it in collaboration with other people. If you don't push for quality, the results will always be very underwhelming.

p.s. For example, at the company where I work now, there are veteran coders who write universally incomprehensible and undocumented code... even in high-level languages. The new coders they hire are also equally awful. The catch is that no one at the company ever bothered to establish and enforce good coding practices, so you get what you get."
"464","A PhD will definitely improve your coding skills. Software engineering skills? Probably not, unless you work with people who have good practice.

There are quite a few people in my lab that came to get their master's or PhD's after being a SE in industry for a while. They always scream when they see my code... I'm not a PhD but...yeah..... :("
"465","I'll probably get downvoted into oblivion for this, but as a software engineer working the past six years in ML, optimization, and simulation, I work with quite a few PhD contributors. Saying something looks like ""PhD code"" is not a compliment. It's often hacked together just enough to illustrate a concept. There are exceptions, but PhD folks are people, too, and not all of them want to be craftsmen (or craftswomen) when it comes to code. In fact, very few of them do.

So, no, in my limited experience, people with PhDs have not had their software engineering skills improved by their university training. But they probably did learn to code or code better."
"466","&gt;software engineer working the past six years in ML, optimization, and simulation

I'm an undergrad and I'm extremely interested in these topics. Do you mind if I pm you a few questions?"
"467","Please do."
"468","Yes, a lot. My Prof came from industry, before her tenure, she worked at Google. Thus, she was pretty experienced and had a different view than someone who never went outside universities. However, she approached most problems very differently from how I used to. Prior to the PhD I had quite a bit of work experience but I was caught in what I would now consider a trap of framework upon framework and ""enterprise best practices"". 

During my time we always built fully functional applications to showcase our resarch and we usually did so from scratch so that we would know about all possible sideeffects. I know that many things we did in terms of software engineering on top of the actual research were probably a very backwards and not best practice (the worst example probably being homegrown webservers from socket code in C and XML/JSON response over HTTP building the strings by hand -- not everything was that bad, of course).

In the long run, I think, this helped me tremendously. Back in industry, it was time to adapt again and, of course, it takes a bit to get used to everything. However, knowing both sides and especially knowing a lot more about fundamentals feels very valueable to me."
"469","You don't enter a PhD program to be a better engineer, you enter to be a better scientist.

Coding is something you get undergrads to do for you =p"
"470","When I completed my PhD (and postdoc), I was convinced I learned a lot about software engineering, and others told me that I wrote nice code. Then I started a role in industry and learned that I knew practically nothing of modern software engineering practices, good testing, design patterns, continuous delivery, agile collaboration, planning / estimating, and all the rest that you will have to deal with as a software engineer (what's a product manager again?).

Long story short - whatever coding you do during your PhD has probably very little in common with ""proper"" software engineering practices, but you'll be able to pick it up quickly. Software engineering involves a lot of stuff, and solving an actual problem with code is just a very small part of it. If you can get that through an internship will depend on the internship - most companies won't let you get close to production code."
"471","A PhD is of course a doctor of philosophy which values much more than the tools of the field. Programming is a tool that researchers can use should they choose, but isn't strictly necessary. I wouldn't expect all construction workers to be experts with a hammer; many only use the hammer once every few weeks."
"472","I coded quite a lot during my PhD which in turn increased my overall SW engineering skills too. Though, im obviously not as skilled now as I would have been when pursuing an industry position right after my masters."
"473","Doing PhD. My fellow research scholars consider me programming wizard. All I do is Google the errors."
"474","So arguing a bit against the mainstream, most PhD programs have fairly limited access to computational resources and so you learn to be much more judicious with experiments and testing when you don't have 1000 EC2 instances you can just fire up. You also usually get quite good at making algorithms CPU/memory efficient so you can iterate quicker. You won't have the same mentorship and rigorously enforced software engineering culture you would at a company, but you can usually find a few allies. You are also (normally) completely free to work with and contribute to open-source which often isn't the case outside of academia and can massively improve your skills. Numpy, Pandas, Spark, Tensorflow, Dask all have excellent coding practices and ecosystems that rival many tech companies."
"475","Yes.

But in more of how to plan and execute projects. I already knew Python  even before my phd.

You can always ask  or read if there's something you don't know, leading your own project is the next level shit."

"489","Do you know of a good source to learn more about the energy use of cryptomining?"
"490","Not off the top of my head, but look around and you'll find some.  On a small scale it's not that bad, but with mining now being as wide spread as it is, and the process being inefficient (by necessity), it ends up wasting a lot of energy.  
  
On it's own this isn't a death sentence to cryptomining, it's only as dirty as what creates the electricity for it, the issues would be drastically reduced if it were powered entirely off of green energy for example (hey, idea:  make crypto miners powered off of wind, solar, nuclear, and geothermal energy to offset their creation costs), but excess energy demand typically takes the dirtiest/cheapest energy sources because it's the easiest to bring to market."
"491","Proof of stake algorithms were supposed to reduce the power waste problems from proof of work algorithms in mining (that give a preference to higher hashrate). But I have fell out of the crypto scene so I don't know if many of the major players have carried through with that conversion."

And it only goes wrong when they're not maintained properly.  So create software that can't be bypassed that forces regulatory compliance."

"504","Hi OP Im no expert I am a lost twenty year old in a CS major with the same hopes as you. My current plan is to do some half/half major between CS and chemistry and then go into a PhD program with my super slick CS skills and.... somehow help solve problems in polymers or batteries? Chemistry majors are well positioned to solve these problems imo. Not sure if my plan will work will update in thirty years."
"505","Probably the best environmental impact you could have would be to make a commonly used program slightly more efficient and save that power from ever being used."
"506","This is a good one, it's along the lines of what I was saying.  If you can do things that result in less power drain, in theory that should reduce environmental impact.  Though in practice, it might just lead to people using more power to take advantage of the excess that's available."

"509","[removed]"
"510","I like associating skills with the projects or work experience subsections to which they pertain. That gives the reader a timeframe in which they were used or learned, as well as the context."
"511","Everyone here bad mouths them, but I'm a hiring manager and I like them. I don't think if you give yourself an arbitrary 9/10 or 10/10 that you're ACTUALLY that skilled at it, but I do use it as a means to easily identify which languages or skills you believe you're better at and which you know but aren't as proficient.  If someone has 3 programming languages listed with different ratings I don't even need to ask them which language I should ask them questions for. 

What I see about these which does annoy me when using these: 

* overly detailed scales (no ticks, but one looks to be 7/10, one 7.5/10, one 8/10 - far too granular)
* Everything is listed as highly rated
* Way too many things listed. Don't rate yourself on 30 different skills. Not even 10
* Soft skills rated. Not useful information really as they tend to be over stated. The one you link - 10/10 hardworking? Like really are you in the literal top 1% of performers when it comes to hardworking-ness? Or do you work really hard like everyone else? I roll my eyes when anyone gives themselves 10/10 on any soft skills. 
* Unsubstantiated claims - and this one drives me NUTS. Give yourself a 4/5 on Java? Fine, but I have to SEE in the rest of your resume where you have used Java and get a good idea from actual words how experienced you are from the rest of your resume. 

So if you really want to use them, do. I don't know of any hiring managers who would throw out your resume for having bars graphs. 

The alternate is to just leave it off, and let the text of your resume to speak for itself. Upon reading I should be able to see in your case for example that you used Java at a job 6 months ago but not at your most recent job. You can always clarify in the actual interview when it matters. Not every interviewer is going to ask, but I usually ask candidates to rate themselves informally or ask what their preferred language is, or what their experience is with a particular language before jumping in with more questions."
"512","I find it too hard to evaluate my level at a language. I mostly do C++ and the more I program, the more I learn how much I don't know about that language. I've met a lot of other students who think they are good at C++ but have no idea what l and r values are, what metaprogramming is or what Boost is. I feel like someone with 10 years of experience in C++ would rate himself a 5/10 when someone with 1 year of experience would rate himself a 7/10."
"513","Yup, and a person I was interviewing with was blown away when someone I was interviewing with 10 years of experience exclusively in Java rated himself as 7/10. The person interviewing with me questioned him, and he replied that well he certainly could know more about java compilers. 

Really, just about everyone rates them around 7/10. I've had interns rate themselves 7/10. It's kind of like the pain scale when you're at the hospital. When you walk in and say your pain is at a 7/10 that's not very important, but if later you're saying it's 10/10 worst pain you've ever had clearly you've gotten worse - the actual score is meaningless - it's the delta which matters. Java listed at 7/10. PHP listed at 5/10? Great I've learned something - not that you're 7/10 on Java but you know Java quite a bit better than PHP."
"514","I'm going to be 40 next month myself. What basically happend to you, and sorry to be blunt, is that you have become complacent over the last X years and didn't really learn anything new. Generally over time people specialise in a certain direction.

What is happening now is that you're starting to get 'stuck' in basically the bottom layer of the software industry: small web agency stuff. It pays like shit, you do the exact same thing time and time again, and because it's simply stuff people generally don't care about doing things 'right' (unit testing, CI/CD, etc.). They just care about cost. 

The problem is that it's easy to get 'stuck' in that layer because companies look mostly at what you've done before. A lot of Bootcamp people get 'stuck' there. And all those Bootcamp grads can do the same thing you're doing, probably for less money. That part of the industry is just a race to the bottom.

So this is an area you will need to get out of, and frankly it's going to be hard and take a LOT of effort on your part. You should first and foremost focus on the type of jobs you want. Is that more enterprise oriented C# for example? Great: tons of work there for experienced developers. But not even understanding unit testing is an instant disqualifier for jobs like that. It's not 2002 anymore, unit tests are the norm. 

So yes, I think for now it's much better to go back to a more junior level because for more 'high end' jobs, where you can actually have a 'career', that's the level you're at now."
"515","&gt; But not even understanding unit testing is an instant disqualifier for jobs like that. It's not 2002 anymore, unit tests are the norm. 

That's why I'm going to join Coursera to understand unit testing.
It's pretty odd though that they don't train you to cover the missing links. I figure if I have least 50% or 60% of their requirements for most jobs they can cover the rest for me in the on-board process of the job."
"516","Why on earth would a company go and train you on something you should know? For a company you not knowing basics like that is a huge red flag: it just shows that hiring you has the risk that they are going to need to spend a LOT of time on you. You don't 'learn' unit testing with a simple course; you just start with the basics. 

And who's going to have to spend that time? Their senior developers. Who really don't want to do that. And are expensive.

Learning testing is not about just knowing how to create a test; it's about how to *design* testable software. This is something that takes years to develop/grow. That course is just a start, it does not take you to the level expected from a senior developer.

I'm sorry but that's just awfully naive, especially for someone who's been in the industry for 10 years."
"517","&gt; Why on earth would a company go and train you on something you should know?

Tell me where I should I pick up this knowledge, then. Do you mean building personal projects to get this knowledge?

&gt; Learning testing is not about just knowing how to create a test; it's about how to design testable software.

I've seen many companies these days expect unit testing from junior developers too. That's why I brought up training. If it's something that companies need a junior dev to do as well, it should be learned very soon."
"518","&gt; Tell me where I should I pick up this knowledge, then. Do you mean building personal projects to get this knowledge?

Projects, courses, yes.

&gt; I've seen many companies these days expect unit testing from junior developers too. That's why I brought up training. If it's something that companies need a junior dev to do as well, it should be learned very soon.

Sure, but that's generally something you start with in an internship and then develop over time. Not something you want to have to teach a senior developer."
"519","In that case then I *do* have to take a course to learn the basics, and I just want to focus on junior level jobs anyways since I am not fit for senior jobs and I do not have internship experience. Recruiters contact me about senior jobs but I tend to ignore those."
"520","Sounds like a plan :) Best of luck!"
"521","Mongo, C#, react, Node...your skill set is not dated as long as you have some depth in the areas you list.  Perhaps interviewing just isn't a strong suit of yours.  Don't worry, its not a strong suit for a lot of people.  I'm of the  mind set that the resume serves one purpose. It gets you that initial phone call, if its consistently doing that then you're set in that regard.

Interviewing for a programming job and ""doing"" a programming job are completely different beasts. It sucks, but its true. As others have mentioned you might gain a lot from doing code challenges on leetcode or codewars.  It helps to develop those skills for quick problem deconstruction like you'll get in white board questions.

Phone interviews are yet another different type of interview. Without the face to face non-verbals and visual aids like a white board you have to sell yourself with your voice, your enthusiasm and your ability to speak well about what you've done.  Its a sale pitch. If they ask what've you been doing for the last few years (and they will), if you go in with a 4 second thought that blandly describes what you did, its over.  

Which sounds better?

&gt;I was a remote engineer doing freelance work. I worked on several small projects for a some non profits with Ruby and MySql. I also built a game.

or

&gt;The last few years have been amazing! I've been helping a lot of nonprofits build a presence in their communities and retool their websites to do X, Y, Z.  Most of my clients had preexisting sites that we extended using Ruby with MySql back-end and most recently I had the opportunity to launch an indie game where the player is tasked with A, B , C and we built that thing from the ground up with C#, so far its sold ### copies.  I've been lucky enough to get a wide breadth of knowledge over the last 4 years but now I'm looking to dive deeper in my next role and that's how I found your company.

Extreme examples to prove a point but hopefully you get my drift. Both of those say the exact same depth of content about the most recent position on your resume...but I'd only bring in the second guy for an in person to get to know him better."
"522","I like the second one more.  The thing is with me, I don't feel **genuine** about writing up my accomplishments that way."
"523","Sounds like maybe you have a bit of a confidence issue? I know I did for the longest time and had the same types of thoughts.  My biggest  hurdle to get over was, ""well yeah, the team built the software that helped 500k customers, but I only really wrote the the code that fetched data and handed it back to a web request.""   So i described it similarly, ""i worked with C# fetching data from SQL server for a REST request"". 

Its a game you play with interviewers.  They know you didn't do everything yourself, they know the day to day is boring and less glamorous than the sizzle you add.  They know the stack overflow searches are many.  But the confidence you exude in how you talk about yourself and your work is equally important (if not more important) than what you say.  In the above examples, the second one has the added benefit of showing pride and commitment in your work.  That's a big plus to any potential employer and isn't something you can directly ask about (its an intangible quality).  Its a big risk hiring someone.  Testing for (and subsequently teaching) technical skills is relatively easy but you have to make them want to work with you and show that you are up the challenge if they take the risk on you.

Think of an interview as a first date (because it is).  If you are the world's most accomplished skydiver billionaire playboy but you can't carry on a conversation or look at your feet the whole time, she isn't going to call you back for a second date."
"524","&gt; I don't feel genuine 

Fuck-all about feeling genuine dude, you're the one living in poverty! You've got good stuff on your resume, i'd spin all that to senior/architect all star! Don't give a Damn about feeling genuine, this is LIFE, no one gives a shit about your integrity or honesty, seriously.

Dude I can not stress this enough; EVERYONE spins their experience and sells themselves. There is no shame in it, it's a game, and you have to play it! What you have to do pass a technical interview. So pick a stack and study interview questions for it; learn what the tricky language questions are etc.

I also stress, you have what others on this sub wish they had; documented experience. The only thing between you and 6 figure salary is some resume juice and study. Dude, $100k after taxes is a $3000 pay check every two damn weeks. Just think about that for a second. three. thousand. dollars. Every fucking pay check.  Think about what you can do for yourself and your family.

For god's sake man, go get it!"
"525","&gt; Mongo, C#, react, Node...your skill set is not dated as long as you have some depth in the areas you list.

That's the problem: he has no depth. Anyone can do a pet project with Mongo and put it on his resume, but that does not make you an attractive candidate. At a 'senior' level you're expected to know the ins and outs of whatever C# framework is current now, not know how to go through a simple Hello World."
"526","Yep I think you almost got it. I do know my way around some MVC frameworks but mostly CodeIgniter and that doesn't get much use these days (compare it to another PHP framework like Laravel). The SaaS product is the most complex thing I've worked on. And the job before that, I've taken a project from flowcharts to a backend MVP.

But also, lack of depth could also be related to not being able to work on anything on a bigger scale and getting a bird's eye view of the whole situation. Most of my day just consists of submitting commits, updating tickets and PR's. Not much depth beyond that. Programming at work feels a lot like programming in my hobby projects, with the exception of having to report updates to my manager at work.

So if I should apply to junior jobs, then should I take some of my older jobs off my resume? I could fill in the empty space with some projects I have worked on."
"527","&gt; Interviewing for a programming job and ""doing"" a programming job are completely different beasts

It's time to combine them into one singular isomorphic beast, then. That way, what's good for the goose is also good for the gander. Then it becomes a piece of cake, second nature."
"528",""" I get some phone interviews for some major companies but can't pass them. ""  


Identify why you are failing your interviews and work on that. What are you having trouble with during the interviews?"
"529","I'm trying my damndest to. But any ""doubt"" actions from interviewers on the phone are hard for me to read, or I cannot identify my own weak points on the phone. Like I said my communication skills have hardly failed me at work which makes this confusing. 

If introspection is what I need, what things can I do to improve my ability to introspect?"
"530","Are you getting technical questions? Make sure you go into the interview feeling confident. If you have trouble with projecting confidence then take a few shots of alcohol for some liquid courage (it works). If you are failing on technical questions you should be able to tell since you will know yourself whether you know the material or not."
"531","I usually get technical questions after the recruiter screening round. It's right after the technical parts that I usually get a rejection.

I know I will fail hard on system design and unit testing which is why I am considering taking Coursera classes for them.

As far as confidence and personality goes, every company's culture is that company's ""personality"". So it's just a matter of finding the right companies that are a personality fit for me. If I cannot change the way I interview to suit certain companies, the viable alternative is to change the types of companies that would find me the most pleasant. Trying to do that the start of this year."
"532","Do leetcode maybe? Most places are dont care which language you use. Out of curiosity what tech stacks are you familiar with and what do you work on? May help me figure out whats going wrong here."
"533","I know mostly the LAMP stack, with both MongoDB and MySQL, plus a bit of Ruby and JavaScript work on the side."
"534","If you are failing after the technical interview you should worry less about being pleasant and more about becoming more technically competent. A person should be pleasant by default when being interviewed for a position. Are the positions you are applying for looking for a LAMP developer? Tailor your resume for each position. If you want a specific job and dont have the skills then train on them. One of the things about this field is you have to constantly retool yourself with new technologies as time goes on."
"535","I want to get out of LAMP stack, and also get into a more modernized development pipeline that uses Continuous Integration and automated testing, plus deploying to cloud services. 

I am considering junior level positions because many people say I have a ""junior"" vibe to my interviews and also because companies allocate more training time to the juniors.

My own experience of deploying websites is mainly limited to uploading files to third party shared hosting (such as BlueHost) and mainly manage them through SSH or a GUI front end like Plesk or cPanel. I don't see anyone talking about those tools anymore."

"538","Out of the FAANG companies, Google and Facebook ignore my resumes. Haven't heard yet from Amazon (I applied more recently).

I know about Leetcode and how it helps out at bigger companies but all the  Leetcode grinding in the world won't do me any good if my resume is the show stopper. I posted my anonymized resume in the OP. What is your resume advice for bigger companies?"
"539","&gt; Out of the FAANG companies, Google and Facebook ignore my resumes. Haven't heard yet from Amazon (I applied more recently).

Frankly with your resume you're just aiming too high."
"540","You can post your resume on rooftopslushie.com where FAANG/big-N engineers offer you detailed feedback on your resume (resume review, career advice, etc) for $5-30 per engineer(you set the price but again, be reasonable). You can ask 5-6 questions (or even more, I dont know).

Ive heard from some people that they even offer referrals but my reviewers said that they didnt have any openings at my level."
"541","I have my resume right in the OP lol, review it here."
"542","What positions are you applying to? Your skills need to match the position you are applying for."
"543","No, if you want advice from FAANG engineers do that. Im not a web developer plus I havent used most of the technologies listed in your resume."
"544","&gt;Maybe I should go back to a junior level job as a temporary stepping  stone but do it at a much better company that actually builds up their  developers well?

It's usually very difficult to get a junior role after you have more than a few years of industry experience."
"545","This is the fate of older devs and well probably be seeing more of this in the years to come. The industry isnt nice to those of us closer to 40 than 20. Even more harsh on those over 40. I dont think anyone has figured it out. There is some myth that older people cant learn, and 18-25 year olds fully believe it. Additionally, non tech business units (and I mean those marketing MBA *units*) dont see devs as anything more than autistic drones. Theyd rather just use us as disposable employees to build them glorious digital whatever that they get the credit for. As such, being older with commitments and opinions doesnt fit with their stereotype. 

Has anyone ever worked for a non tech company that has strong executives that was promoted out of the IT or engineering paths? Usually even CTOs either come from other departments or its a title granted on top of CFO or COO. Were second class citizens. 

Anyways, sorry I dont have anything useful to contribute. My experience is more dated and as much as I try to develop myself through a graduate degree outside of work, the projects at work arent there and they dont seem too interested in my future."
"546","&gt; This is the fate of older devs and well probably be seeing more of this in the years to come.

Nonsense. I'm almost 40. What happened here was that he didn't gain 12+ years of experience, he gained 1 years of experience and then kept doing the same thing for 10 years. This has nothing to do with age."
"547","Any articles you can recommend that talk about probable solutions to the problem of 1x10 years of experience?"
"548","Well it's simple: work hard during your job or on your own time fulling the gaps. But while it's simple, it's not easy. It just takes a lot of time. And there are no simple courses to give experience you'd normally gain on the job. 

You should start by trying to focus on a certain stack when it comes to jobs, so you don't have your experience / skills all over the place. I mean I've done PHP and ColdFusion in the past for example, but I don't even have those on my resume because they're not relevant to the jobs I aim for."
"549","I don't want to do PHP anymore, but it is tricky to try and completely remove it from my resume (if I were to remove older jobs) because I used it as recently as my *most recent* non-freelance job. I only became PHP-free when I started freelancing. In some freelance gigs I have picked up most recent experience with Ruby on Rails. Outside of its rather odd syntax the framework does make a lot of familiar sense to me. MV* has in general been something I can grok fairly well whether I want to use Rails, React or Vue."
"550","Im interested in this as well. Personal projects lose steam and generally arent as helpful to get one past HR filters as they are sold to be."
"551","&gt; The industry isnt nice to those of us closer to 40 than 20. Even more harsh on those over 40. 

I still don't buy though. If it were true then this career would actively discourage retiring at the normal age of 60-65. And CS would be much less popular then, because how many would willingly take up a career with an early death?"
"552","People just repeating the myths they heard. Its not about age, its about people who don't continue to learn and adapt which is often correlated with age."
"553","Its not about being old. Its about refusing to learn new and relevant skills that are in demand."
"554","Companies like older devs, what they don't like is older devs that have the skills of a junior dev.

When you have 10+ years of experience as a developer, most companies expect at least a senior engineer level of aptitude. If you're lacking that, then many companies will judge you as incompetent and less capable of learning/improving than average, and will likely pass on you."
"555","Your resume seemed fine. And being in your 30s and 40s is fine as a SWE. Heres what matters:

 Skillset  Java and Python are really good to have. 

 LinkedIn profile  Try setting your location on LI to somewhere in the Bay Area or other tech hub and see how many recruiters hit you up. Make sure your LI settings indicate youre actively looking for a job. Make sure you put your complete work history and skillset on LI for SEO. 

 Once you get the phone interview, you will be expected to interview as a Senior. For this, prepare using Leetcode and system design tutorials like Grokking the System Design Interview. Cracking the Code Interview is also good. 

You can do it. Just a matter of time, studying, and persistence."
"556","Does system design require an understanding of the deployment pipeline around it?

I don't see anyone talking about those tools anymore."
"557","Its like  how would you design a URL shortening service (the backend)? Think of bit.ly.

- Would you have a load balancer, and how would it generally work?
- Would you have multiple datacenters, and if so where?
- What kind of database(s) would you use?
- What level of reliability do you need? And what are you targeting?
- Whats your actual URL shortening algorithm?
- How many URLs would your system be able to support (roughly) and would you scale the design to handle more URLs or more queries per second?

All these questions. Thats system design. Basically if you are to design a backend system from ground up."
"558","Instead of playing around on reddit you should be focusing on developing skills that are in demand. You have said multiple times through this thread that you know about modern technologies but then complain that employers should train you in these skills...

"565","If you already have an interview, the people interviewing you probably already have that resume, it's too late.

I'd say at this point your options are either to own up to it, which you can do gracefully. Or cram it, which honestly might work.

Overall, I'd say don't embellish on your resume. If you have a little experience with a skill, but not much, just put something like

&gt; foo (some experience)

As an interviewer I'd take that to mean ""this person has worked with it, probably can get something done, but is not an expert, would love to dig in a bit more and see what they know.""

If you are not comfortable with the above, you probably shouldn't even have it on the resume at all."
"566","Yes"
"567","What skill did you embellish, and what role are you being considered for? If youre being interviewed by individual teams that usually means youre being considered for something more specialized like an ML team or mobile development specialist.

Will this lead to losing an offer? Possible, because it definitely sounds like youre being targeted for specialist roles. They might also just decide to add you to the general software engineer pool if the teams youre talking to all take a pass, but thats not a guarantee either."

Have you built stuff outside of class that uses these concepts? Depending what you've been exposed to &amp; used, your understanding of ""fundamental CS concepts"" might be different from somebody accustomed to another language.  

Build something in the language you're most comfortable in that forces you to apply the concepts you want to learn. Then build it (or something similar) again in a different language where the concepts are implemented differently, or don't even exist. Coming at things from different angles and in multiple contexts can help you recognize patterns &amp; solidify  understanding. 

If you build the same project with C++, Java, Swift, and Python, you would have to use abstract classes, inheritance, and interfaces/protocols in completely different ways, and you'll likely understand them better in the end."
"575","Can't say I agree with the first paragraph. Practicing ""pitching"" the concepts help, but it's limited. Especially pitching to people who don't understand. The reason is, the issue that OP says sounds more like he doesn't understand the concepts.

The remaining parts are all great points. I would suggest the same thing from a different angel: Find some real world scenario, choose a language, and build the same thing in different ways, for example, abstract class vs interfaces. It wouldn't take long for you to notice the difference and find a reason about why choose this over that? Keep doing this is likely the most efficient way to really grasp the core, IMO."
"576","I'm... not sure how you passed a data structures and/or algorithms course, but this is still certainly fixable.

 \- an ArrayList, more or less; something backed by an array that resizes itself if you put too much in there  
 \- a first-in, first-out queue

 \- binary tree  
 \- heap  
 \- undirected graph, represented as objects/pointers

 \- AVL balanced binary tree, using the binary tree from above  
 \- linear probing hashtable, using one of those resizeable arrays from above  


I'd pick a language, probably Java, C#, or Python.  And I'd implement each of those without using anything other than language primitives.  (Only use int, string, arrays, loops, functions, and if statements.)  I'd write unit tests to make sure they worked.   And then move to the next one.  Possibly go through the list of things twice, and make sure it gets ridiculously faster the second time.  


Until you've got at least half of that list, you're going to have a hell of a time with interviews, so just sack a weekend or two and do it.  


Separately, for ""I don't know object oriented stuff"", you're just going to need to write more object oriented code."
"577","If OP is anything like me, the data structures course was taught by a grad student just doing it to check off a box, and gave everyone A's and B's even though we understood very little.

We didn't have a specific Algorithms course, some was covered in datastructures, but I picked most of that up on my own."
"578","My algorithms course was taught by a professor who was like 70 years old and tenured. He was a math guy, really, but was part of the CS dept to teach these types of courses. I had to take a few of his courses over the years, and each class was the same. Everyone got an A or B no matter what. Often times, he would not even teach or quiz you on the actual subject, but some other unrelated subject he went on a tangent about. It was really frustrating, but as a student who switched majors late and worked a factory job, it was somewhat nice having one less class to study for. I pay for it now by not knowing shit and just work IT instead."
"579","I had a professor exactly like this at Florida State lmao. Idk how I passed some of his classes"
"580","I think I know exactly who you mean, and he still is teaching there"
"581","Oh yeah. I just graduated 5 months ago and I had him as one of my last classes lol. Good God he was painful as a lecturer but man is he intelligent if you talk to him one on one. He has all kinds of knowledge. Hes like the perfect grandpa for me lol."
"582","At least you guy got A or B for your resume. I had teachers who were too strict that even if your code is one second slower than his solution, you'll get C or below. My GPA really sucks that I can't even apply for graduate school."
"583","I pride myself in fast solutions but there was one assignment that my TA graded (it was in class grading) and he took points off because it took minutes to run (literal minutes). We tried to find out why it was so slow but even when we analyzed the code, neither of us could come up with an answer of why it was so slow. Still havent figured it out to this day lol"
"584","Is that normal in the states? In Canada, we learn Linked Lists to Heaps in first year.."
"585","It varies widely. The best schools bake strong DSA fundamentals into all their classes. Good schools can have a weak DSA class but bake the knowledge into other classes."
"586","I've seen up through linked lists in the intro course, and a full data structures course in the second semester, that should cover most of it.  Some universities have a separate junior or senior-level course on algorithms that goes much farther, but the data structures course is the most transferrable to industry (and to industry interviews, for various companies)."
"587","I'm from Canada and we learnt it in second year. York U student here"
"588","I'm at Queens. We have 2 python courses each sem, the 2nd sem one we do some data structures, searching &amp; sorting, complexity, recursion, that stuff. Though most is also taught in second year (DFS/BFS, Dijkstra, Prim/Kruskal, Hashing, Red Black Tree, etc)."
"589","&gt; Is that normal in the states?

No"
"590","It probably varies a lot by school. In the spring of my freshman year, we implemented a singly linked list, hash set, and a priority queue with a heap, along with a few other things"
"591","Can confirm, in Alberta and we learn all sorts of data structures (not as rigorously as an algo course) in winter semester of first year."
"592","Yup yup same"
"593","That sounds like great practice. But for the record, I've never been asked about any of those data structures in interviews."
"594","Youve never been asked a Linked List, Queue, Stack, heap or binary tree question in an interview? Even non tech companies asked me LL or stack questions."
"595","I have been doing development for about 20 years and I have never had to implement from scratch any data structure. I vaguely remember them from sophomore year at school.

Both Java and .NET have implementations of most major data-structures if one needs to use them. And I am 100% sure however that is done I couldn't do it better."
"596","Knowing how the data structures work at a fundamental level makes it very easy to explain characteristics of them abstractly. You obviously will probably never have to do it in practice, but the meta knowledge is useful."
"597","Yeah I get that, but think about how ridiculous that is. Over the last 20 years how many frameworks, custom libraries, sets of controls, ORMs, patterns and other things I had to learn on a year to year basis and somehow still do 40+ hours of work and have some kind of family / personal life ... but I should be expected to remember something that I learned in 1997 for 3-4 weeks and NEVER used again. 

I mean I know what a link list is, I know how to use it but hell if I remember how to implement it. But I can 100% Google the concept in in a day or two do it. But that's not what they want in an interview, they want you to spit these things out cause ... I don't even know why."
"598","Its mostly eliminating false positive candidates. I imagine there are probably far less people who can whiteboard a LC hard graph problem who are poor coders than there are very shitty programmers who excel at solving them.

Of course they also probably plan to discriminate a bit against a older workforce for cultural and financial reasons."
"599","I think the idea that solving complex programming skills isn't practically useful is bogus, no matter how much it is cargo culted on this subreddit.

That said, I really like your comment. In some domains, you will never need a trie, but I know some interviewers ask questions which can't be solved optimally without them. Someone who can tell you how a trie works probably has some other excellent engineering or academic work. It obviously doesn't prove they are a great engineer, but this reasoning that there are more great engineers that know tries than not is probably true.

As far as ageism goes, I don't think the age thing is intentional, but I do agree that these sorts of questions bias towards 'recency of college degree', which indirectly hurts older candidates. We need to be careful to also ask questions which capture engineers with the invaluable talent and experience and understand the inherent biases in our interviewing techniques."
"600","You're missing the people who are good at what they do and can't whiteboard an ""LC hard"" graph problem without spending some time learning it because it has nothing to do with their expertise."
"601","He's talking about false positives, and you're talking about missing out on quality candidates. Both are bad and you have to give someone a chance eventually, but false positives are very expensive to companies and I think the priority in hiring has shifted toward avoiding them. 

In my interview process for my job there was no whiteboarding or anything like that. There was a screening to weed out ""poor culture fits"" and unqualified candidates early, then a brief technical interview, (a *conversation* about things I've worked on previously, what I knew about the new company's stack, and any questions I had for them) then there was a take-home challenge to see if I could make something simple (8hrs of work) and functional in the company's stack, an interview about that to see if I really made the solution myself and more importantly if I had decent technical communication skills, then a personality test to see my ""working style"", and finally after all that was graded, I met with a higher up to get further vetted and discuss anything else

I think whiteboarding is a bullshit way to assess technical competency for a developer, when there are significantly better ways, like what my company did. If you want to make sure someone can do something, ask them to do that thing. I'm sure white boarding will fall out of favor with any not google-esque companies that are still using it for some reason. I also think this sub is overly focused on whiteboarding, leetcode shit, and overly academic things"
"602","Im not because the companies dont care about losing quality candidates when their pipeline of quality candidates vastly exceeds how many they realistically hire.

If that ever changes they will look for alternatives."
"603","Because people relying on abstractions and frameworks without understanding what's happening under the hood is an actual problem."
"604","Probably the realest issue emerging over the next 10 years for Dev."
"605","if you know what a linked list is, but not how to implement it, maybe you don't know what a LL is.

also i know not everybody is into blockchain, but it's basically a giant linked list with a little crypto. git is also basically just a LL.

someone else isn't always going to write the code first. us senior people are supposed to be the ones inventing frameworks and platforms, not waiting for someone else to do it. we can't lose sight of the building blocks."
"606","That's the cost of being a professional though, right? Doctors are expected to operate tools *and* interpret the results. They need to understand biological processes in the human body at low and high levels, as well as how to apply medicine to alter them. I don't think I agree that it's ridiculous to expect a software engineer to have the same degree of competence over a computing machine.

You won't always need to know how a binary search tree works, but sometimes you do. As a person that conducts interviews at a big tech company, I'm trying to hire someone who I'm confident can make the right decisions and confidently implement or advise on solutions. These things do and have come up in my experience as an engineer. Maybe some software niches don't have the same requirements, and they should meter hiring appropriately. That has not been my experience in my field."
"607","The difference is if a doctor has 20 years experience and he is interviewing for a job he isn't going to be asked about stuff he learned in Medical School. It's just assumed he knows it or knows how to learn it.

He will be asked about his experience, how he applies the latest tools and how he treats patients related to his area. Like for example a dentist, who is a MD and at some point in time cut up cadavers to remove their spleen or whatever isn't going to be asked when s/he joins a dental practice about his/her ability on how to remove an appendix. Even though s/he probably learned that in school."
"608","&gt;I mean I know what a link list is [...] but hell if I remember how to implement it. 

I don't think these two clauses are consistent.  Balancing algos for trees... fine, I get it, but a linked list is just a simplest-possible node (an object with a value and a pointer to another node, recurse as necessary), and some helper functions to find stuff, and add/remove stuff between existing pairs of nodes.

If you need to google that to replicate that in your favorite language, you don't know what a LL is, and if you don't know what a LL is, you won't know when it's a terrible idea to use one."
"609","Implementation would involved all the insert, remove, traverse etc .. functionality that you would want. So yeah I know what a linked list is, I don't know off the top of my head all the functionality needed to implement one. I am not saying google the actual code on a linked list but more of a complete spec of what is required to make a linked list.

A good way to think about it is, you know how to ride a bicycle, but now out of the blue you need to write an essay explaining in detail to someone who has no idea what a bicycle is how to do it. It will take you a few moments to switch your brain so you can work in that mind set and even think of the vocabulary to do it. (actually this would be a better interview question than having someone explain to you what a linked list is)

And before I would use it in my code I would google it and think about if it is the right thing for the task I am using. Anytime I have a complex problem that requires more than basic coding I will google it to see if anyone has done something similar, how and why they did it and is there gotchas to it that I might not be thinking of. If nothing else it might get my brain going in another direction as it reminds me of one of the thousands of things I have learned over the years that is probably a better solution.

Frankly using random data structures in code for the sake of using them is a terrible idea. Just as much as it is using random framework or design patterns. And as someone who works on a lot of legacy code I see that all the time."
"610","A day or two is a long time for something like that. I've definitely had to use these data structures during internships and even my personal life"
"611","I say day or two because I am so used to all the other BS that goes along with a job that to get 3-4 hours of coding takes a day or two."
"612","That makes more sense. I was silently judging thinking you meant 2 full days. That sounds a lot more reasonable. I'm lucky and don't have too many BS meetings and politics to work through at work so I can just get busy. I take it for granted lol

I was going to say, if you know what a linked list is, creating it should be trivial. Maybe a little bit of time if you botch the insert/delete functions. Even then like you said, you could quickly Google psuedo code to follow in whatever language you are using."
"613","This is true.

Obviously it depends on the person who do this, but personally I think that building them from scratch is one of the best ways to understand why some of them are better for certain tasks than others. Where the ups and downs are etc.

However as you stated, most companies won't ask you to implement them, they will just expect you to know which one to use."
"614","I agree that we should know how to build them from scratch, I just personally found that actually drawing it out helps me choose what's best.

Drawing out something to represent data and using arrows to direct how you are adding and accessing it will pretty much make a visualization of the appropriate data structure"
"615","I agree that we should know how to build them from scratch, I just personally found that actually drawing it out helps me choose what's best.

"617","I think the companies are just looking for the lowest common denominator, especially when interviewing someone who is a fresh grad or a very junior dev.

In cases where ppl with solid experience under their belts get drilled on these things especially for positions where this sort of knowledge is not required is beyond me. 

I do ask some basic data structure questions when interviewing ppl - like ""what's a hash in a hashmap"" and then go on to ask about collisions etc, even if they don't know how it's actually impld I just want to see the train of thought. So now if you as a developer for 20 years don't know this I'd just be surprised lol, I mean this can be at play if e.g. you need to impl your own hash code method etc - so it is reasonably relevant to a day to day."
"618","Wow lucky. I got asked implement a HashTable and a Trie for frontend engineer positions shrug"
"619","This is because interviewers are bad at their jobs"
"620","like with a hashing function, re-sizing depending on load factor, and everything? all in a 45(?)min interview?

something like this? https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementing-our-own-hash-table-with-separate-chaining-in-java/"
"621","I thought they were talking about being asked problems that involved those data structures, sometimes multiple. Sometimes interviewers ask you to implement a custom data structure or modify a known one. Ive also never had to create one from scratch on the job but thats swe interviewing for ya."
"622","It's surprisingly common not to see any of those.


However, it's probably going to depend a bit on which area of CS you go into.

The only data structure I've been asked about has been regular arrays. Even then, not about the data structure, just a problem with an Array in it and I did need to know how they worked as well as some logic and loops ofc.

Edit: I've only worked at largeish corporations though."
"623","Not everyone interviews at faang companies. Most of my programming jobs have been analyst jobs that involve programming and the interviews have never been technical."
"624","Interviewed for a mid-sized regular company for a non-entry level position, the technical portion I had to implement a depth first search for a binary tree on a white board, and additionally implement a prime-number checking function. It was basically a fizz-buzz interview, but I was under the impression that it didn't matter how I did on those, they just wanted to hear me talk and write through it.
  
  
I'm curious if a lot of these differences in interview have more to do with geography than the type of company you're interviewing for...
  
  
EDIT: I'm in the Mormon Corridor, who're trying desperately to brand themselves as the ""Silicon Slopes.""
EDIT 2: On reflection, they also asked me compiler level questions."
"625","Possibly. Not OP but I have yet to see algorithm or data structures come up in interviews in Arkansas"
"626","Definitely depends on company. For my online assessments theres usually 1-2 of DP, graph DFS/BFS, 2d matrixes, tries, or BSTs. A few companies pulled out stats, lin alg, and topological sort. These were all for internship positions =-"
"627","Well, you are at uWaterloo and most likely applying for big names company / startups as many waterloo kids does. What you are experiencing is definitely not the norm.

I explicitly avoid those companies as I am too lazy to grind enough leetcode to pass their interview."
"628","Oof. Its starting to sound like internships are banking on you sticking with them through the rest of college due to the requirements for ""entry level"" positions."
"629","Be aware that the guy is from Uwaterloo and their culture / competition is completely different than most other universities even among top Canadian universities. He's probably interning at big tech companies / startups."
"630","Utah, lol?  I just had a bunch of recruiters on here try to sell me and that desperation shone through."
"631","Sounds about right.  
  
I mean, it's  awesome if you're the outdoorsy/snowboardy type, but for most people they'd likely prefer to live and work in other states. The major positives I can say is that I've had a 40 hour work week for almost my entire time here, and we've got fiber internet. I worked for a company out of San Diego and was regularly pushing 60 hours."
"632","Could be, might also depend on the industry and what kind of stuff they work on."
"633","That's probably true as well. I know my network engineering friends interviews all end up sounding like pop-quizzes."
"634","Yeah, sorry, I haven't. I've only had a couple interviews that wanted code samples.
But I've had a lot more questions about, say, experience with cloud architecture patterns, or how I managed logging and monitoring, or how I delivered on business problems.
It might be a different story right out of a degree, where they just want to know if you paid attention in class."
"635","I have *only* been asked about those by Microsoft. Literally no one else in the industry has bothered to ask. This is after dozens of interviews."
"636","What? 90% of my interviews I've at least been asked about data structures, and even had to implement them in some interviews. It's fundamental Computer Science, and I'm worried about all these CS grads who don't seem to be grokking the material at all. People should be taking entire classes dedicated to data structures."
"637","You are aware that most business requirements are best met by solutions that need no algorithmic skills whatsoever, like at all?"
"638","slight generalization?"
"639","Good luck meeting some *real* business requirements with a group of ""engineers"" who don't know their fundamentals. I wouldn't want to work at a place that hires people who don't know CS."
"640","Sorry buddy, but that's just not my experience. And I've done a lot more interesting work than just CRUD apps. 

I'm sure there have been times I could have implement more interesting solutions if I had a stronger traditional CS background. Though from my experience, ""interesting"" solutions are usually the ones you want to avoid ;-)"
"641","Right. Most businesses are powered by a crud app, just saying"
"642","More or less how many interviews have you done if you don't mind me asking?"
"643","Oh man, I've been doing this around 8 years, I'm on my third job, had a small handful of interviews at each change.
Maybe it's different coming right out of a CS degree. I kind of lucked my way into my first position, and then had some concrete work to stand in after that."
"644","That sounds more like a damn great way to fall asleep. OP can't program in the first place, I would rather suggest programming to the point of knowing the difference between an interface and an abstract class before wasting time on implementing more obscure data structures you might need to know about in interviews."
"645","Ha, maybe. But to each their own, eh?"
"646","This is a good list. I had to implement almost all of these in C++ in my data structures class and it really makes you understand how they work under the hood. I can answer pretty much any question about how hash tables or AVL trees work because the code for it is burned into my brain."
"647","Probably overkill. Arrays and HashMaps and Sets will get you 95% of the way there."
"648","Ive implemented those multiple times in the past but theres no way I can write those data structures off the top of my head. I think its unreasonable to expect someone to do so."
"649","Anyone can implement a linked list.  If they say they can't, they're probably just getting tripped up by some language-specific syntax.  A scavenger hunt (the one where each clue tells you where to find the next) is effectively a linked list."
"650","I had one of the better profs for the course and most of my peers in that class seemed to have retained the knowledge, so I think it's just a lack of repetition and practice for me (I took it about a year ago). Thanks for writing out a list of structures to implement!

edit: grammar"
"651","&gt; - an ArrayList, more or less; something backed by an array that resizes itself if you put too much in there

found the java programmer"
"652","That is WAY overkill for just trying to get your foot in the door. You can probably stop at binary tree if you're not applying to the big four. Even then, I would only expect to see directed graphs or avl balanced binary trees very rarely."
"653","Yeah, non-big four here, binary tree was about as far as my last interview went. Binary trees, explaining the difference between DFS and BFS, as well a question on if I could implement another data structure with their generic Node object (you could, it was a Doubly Linked List). It was pretty straight forward, mainly to suss out if I was full of shit or not about what I learned in college."
"654","And this is exactly why the impostor syndrome is so prevalent. Because communities like this upvote posts like his where people are putting more effort into bragging than they are actually explaining the industry. People come here looking for actual industry advice, and they get regurgitated big four factoids instead. It's no wonder people will think they're not up to snuff when someone is telling them that they need to be able to implement directed graphs and avl balanced binary trees on the fly right out of college just to get in the industry."
"655","I guess the community is just hungry for Big Four stuff. I mean, you can have a satisfying life as a programmer anywhere, at any company, and not have to fight the hordes to get noticed by Google-senpai. Not that there's anything wrong with fighting the hordes either, but yeah, it seems to be a theme here."
"656","I don't think it's hunger at all - I think it's circular logic. People upvote those posts because they're most like the posts they've agreed with in the past. They downvote anything outside of that because people use it to justify a very elitist attitude: non-big four jobs aren't ""real"" programming. Of course, very few people here actually have a big four job, but since imposter syndrome is so prevalent... it's a cycle."
"657","I think it absolutely is hunger. A big 4 salary is like a golden ticket to most people into total compensations of almost 200k out of college, why would there not be a huge demand to get in and find out info about them?"
"658","Most people at the big four are not making 200k right out of college. Many people with 5+ years of experience are not making 200k at the big four. The other problem with this reddit is that it tricks people into believing that the highest tiers of compensation are the average."
"659","If you can't get promoted from L3 to L4 in 5 years then the problem is probably on you.

https://www.levels.fyi/"
"660","On the positive side, you're probably smarter than half the people here because you realize it's not some kind of syndrome.  You could start implementing all kinds of different data structures and algos."
"661","This is so frustrating to me. Any time I've ever voiced concerns people are always like ""oh it's just imposter syndrome bro we all deal with it!""

like no dude I'm knowledgeable enough to realize that I LACK knowledge and skill and it makes me worried for my career"
"662","the question around impostor is probably more a ""should I be expected to just solve every problem, know all things and create new ones with my hands in my pocket"" vs ""am I allowed to struggle with some"""
"663","[deleted]"
"664","Right but then when I continually have difficulty applying it and people reassure and say it takes time etc., that's when worry sets in and people regurgitate ""imposter syndrome"" to make you feel better"
"665","Impostor syndrome is real, though, and this reddit is a perfect example. A lot of people get duped into believing that the interview standards used by the big four are industry standards, or that they represent the type of work that actually gets done in the industry. Neither of those are actually true, but if you believe it, you're going to get awfully anxious thinking about trying to climb a ladder in the industry."
"666","A lot of legitimate imposters use imposter syndrome to make them feel better about their own lack of ability. 

We dont have the standards of being an architect or doctor. The industry as a whole really has a massive amount of people who dont know what theyre doing. 

Theres a big difference between a competent frontend software engineer having to whiteboard some leetcode hard graphing algorithms in 30 minutes and the same engineer not knowing complexity analysis, data structures, and practical problem solving skills thats a fundamental part of their profession.

Ive literally interviewed people before who cannot solve fizzbuzz-difficulty problems."
"667","Ive felt this way before. My recommendation is actually to start off with Hackerranks videos on data structures and algorithms (very short, very well explained). Then go from there"
"668","Also they cover really popular interview questions. Their videos are pretty awesome"
"669","Thank you!! This is a great resource."
"670","I *totally* know what the difference between an purely abstract class and interface is, but for someone reading this who doesn't, what is it?"
"671","An abstract class can have method code alongside the method signatures, while an interface is only method signatures.

So you could have a PaymentProcessor abstract class that has a filled-out purchase() method that also calls a filled-out validateUser() method, then calls  signature-only like validatePaymentMethod(), makePurchase(), then calls filled-out methods like handleError(), recordPurchase(), deliverItem().  Such a class would be extended for CreditCard, Paypal, InternalRefund, or Bitcoin subtypes, where you deal with different real-life payment processors (or realistically different vendors).   

Look up Facade or Command patterns in your preferred language for more examples."
"672","So I understand that, but what if all the methods are also abstract and not filled out? Is there really any difference between an abstract class and an interface?"
"673","Semantics. If you're defining an abstract class without any defined methods or stored state, you should probably use an interface instead, to better convey what your actual intention is.

There may be some libraries/frameworks that require interfaces specifically. For example, I believe OSGi requires your class to implement an interface before you can export that as an OSGi service.

Note that as of Java 8, the distinction between abstract classes and interfaces blurs even more, because interfaces can now define default methods."
"674","Oh, I thought you said ""purely"" as kind of a typo, so I ignored that.

If the language permits subtyping identically, there's no difference in the types to me.  I haven't programmed in Java for so long, I couldn't say."
"675","The difference is an abstract class can store state. Methods and fields (static final in java) in an interface are public while abstract classes can use more restrictive levels."
"676","In addition to what others have said, you can have a class implement multiple interfaces, but only inherit up to one abstract class, so there's a benefit to making something an interface if it is appropriate."
"677","No, an abstract class represents _implementation_ which might include state."
"678","Im not sure I understand your reply. Are you saying abstract classes cant or shouldnt contain state?

Abstract classes are definitions. If I define one with class/instance fields then what am I doing wrong?"
"679","You say the difference is that they can store state. That's not what an abstract class is. 

What makes an abstract class different is it contains _implementation_. This can include state. But it's more general than that, and includes method implementation as well."
"680","Ohhh... In my defense, I use Java and default methods allow for implementation in interfaces.

In the case of a purely abstract class and traditional interface what would be their main differences? Im only coming up with scope and flexibility for their implementations."
"681","Somewhat depends on the exact language and rules for Objects for the most part, especially if they allow multiple inheritance. Multiple inheritance can get messy, so a lot of languages only let you inherit from a single class, but your class can implement any number of interfaces. Generally, inheriting from a Class C means A is an C (e.g. a Dog is an Animal), but  implementing an interface I means A can do I (a Dog can Move and Implements Mover, but Cars can also Move, but would be Vehicles). You separate out abilities from your object model which allows for more reasonable expectation of how you design your class structure"
"682","I finally just got this drilled into my head yesterday as a senior because I needed it for a design patterns midterm lol. An abstract class is a class with at least 1 abstract method. An interface is a class with only abstract methods. Every sub class is required to provide an implementation for each abstract method"
"683","So an interface is just a subset of an abstract class basically and there is no true difference if an abstract class has all abstract methods?"
"684","Well, a class can implement multiple interfaces, so there's some benefit to making it an interface."
"685","In addition to the above, in languages such as Java, we can only subclass one class but we are able to implement multiple interfaces."
"686","Abstract classes can store state."
"687","Look, I'm no expert but I think you should just sit down and code. Practice writing a Stack or Queue from scratch, don't just read the defs, actually use them to build something."
"688","I just had an interview yesterday where I couldn't explain difference between interface vs abstract class properly. I felt dumb because it is something I learned in my freshman year. I understand the concepts it's just I am not good at explaining with words."
"689","A good example that helped me would be to have a Vehicle abstract class. Then have Concrete classes such as Car, SUV, Truck, etc. They all inherit functions like drive(), stop() blah blah. Then an interface would be like a set of functionality that a vehicle subclass needs to be guaranteed to have. Like V8Engine and V6Engine interfaces. Which each come with different capabilities.

I also recommend reading Head First Design Patterns. Youll see somewhat less contrived examples."
"690","Let me take a shot here :)

I like to think of it as, purpose-wise they're different, because functionality wise they're becoming more similar.

The biggest difference is, one (abstract) class can implement multiple interfaces, while can only extend a single abstract class. The leads to, interfaces are good at describing behaviors, like a duck can both walk, and quack. But with abstract class, it's more suitable for describing ""what it is"", like a duck is an animal.

There are languages that allow multiple inheritance, like C++ or Python, and in those languages, the term abstract class or the difference there is vague. But if the terms are defined clearly, it shouldn't very hard to tell the difference."
"691","&gt;I legitimately do not understand any data structures 

I seriously doubt this.  Most data structures are VERY simple conceptually.  I believe the problem is how most of them are taught.  I understand things visually, and topics such as data structures can be explained very easily with images whereas written/spoken language makes them insanely complicated.  Once you get into structures outside of 3 dimensions (4-D arrays), they can be hard to grasp functionally though, even if the concept is similar.  

Take a look at these, just looking at the pictures:  [Array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-arrays/), [Linked List](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/linked-list/), [Stack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure/).  Just look at the pictures and read the very brief descriptions.

&gt;unable to explain ""fundamental"" CS concepts to anyone (like abstract classes vs. interfaces - i keep forgetting the differences).

This isn't ""failing to understand"" anything, it's simply a vocabulary problem.  I've got a bachelor's and a master's degree in CS.  When I was taking my final exams for my master's degree, I totally flipped out because the test was only about 12 questions (covering everything in the program), but the questions were things like ""Explain how [*Name of Core Concept*] can be used to solve the problem of [*what you'd use it for*].""  I've never had as much of a feeling of dread as when I was taking that test because there were several of the [*Core Concepts*] that I was completely drawing a blank on, and had no clue what the questions were even talking about.  When I told my professor that I had no clue what the [*Core Concepts*] were, she acted like it was no big deal.  She just told me [*Core Concept*] is [*10 second explanation of what it is*].  She knew I knew the material, and once she reminded me of what it was, I was able to write pages of info about those concepts.  It was simply a vocabulary problem.

And as for the difference between abstract classes and interfaces, I wouldn't consider those ""fundamental"" concepts, and as long as you have the general idea of what they are, you can look up the specifics when you need them.  The real world doesn't consist of ""closed book tests"".  I've got almost 20 years in the field, but I'll still Google stupid simple things like ""how to sort an array in Javascript"".  My head is too full of things like understanding the full conceptual model of a complex 20 table application and the data relationships to worry about the fact that I can't just instantly spit out the best way to sort a Javascript array."
"692","thank you so much - I also learn visually so those links were extremely helpful."
"693","&gt; When I was taking my final exams for my master's degree

Huh... I just did the coursework and graduated (non-thesis track). Some of the courses had finals, but many didn't (with most of the grade being based on a paper or project instead).

Algorithms though... F*** that class. Only one I got a C in (during my MS, my BS had a few more :P). Most of it I kind of got, but it was just time consuming... Like ""Perform the following operations on a red-black tree...."" Even using the book as a reference (open book test) that set of problems alone took a good 20-30 minutes just because of all the re-balancing you'd have to do."
"694","&gt; When I was taking my final exams for my master's degree

I was actually referring to the single, final, comprehensive exam encompassing all of the courses I took. I don't remember which actual courses had final exams, but it certainly wasn't all of them.  But it was the final, ""everything rides on this one test"" exam where this happened."
"695","Ah, yeah, for me Algorithms was one of those classes where a significant part of the grade was the final exam... and it was a required class and anything below a C was failing and a C got you put a warning since you needed a 3.0 cumulative GPA to graduate. It was a very stressful semester :("
"696","Hello,

If you want to learn Problem Solving skills (generic)

"699","Thanks so much, this is an amazing tool!"
"700","You should try to code everyday. Set some time and then sit down and code for that amount of time everyday. Most of these can be learnt theoretically but they will not stick around if you don't practice/use them. Focus on easy problems but play as much as you can with the data structures. In my data structure and algorithms class we had to build linked list, doubly linked list, red black tree, etc. ourselves from scratch, which was an awful lot of work but really helped reinforce the theory. I can always explain the data structures that I have implemented from scratch, at least the idea behind it."
"701","There are plenty of jobs for you where you can be productive in higher level languages without understanding the theoretical CS data structures. If you can get code to do what you want you'll be alright if that's what you're worried about. Yeah it's good to know this stuff but you won't be homeless if you don't"

The most important think for you to focus on now is getting your resume looking sharp, sending copies of it to every corner of the earth, and building confidence in yourself.

Youve gotten this far because youre smart. Just keep chugging. If youre overwhelmed, take a break for a day or two, and do something you enjoy."
"707","It's pretty common. Both in the sense in that feeling this way when it's not true is pretty common, and colleges producing CS students lacking in core CS skills is pretty common.


But good news! I've been employed for quite some time now, and I dropped out, and I can't explain either of those things (I mean, I've *used* them as recently as yesterday, but I'd have to google it for maybe the 5th or 6th time to explain it properly, which is harder than just using them day to day).

Lacking in problem solving skills and

&gt; I've been flunking all technical interviews that ask me questions I haven't seen before.

this are bigger problems, but they're solvable.


So it sounds like you have three problems. Lack of practical experience solving problems, lack of some specific memorization for interviews, and lack of confidence.

-----

So first off, I recommend working on some projects on your own that you don't know how to solve, and solving them without an answer being handed to you. While I generally despise the whole 'leetcode grind' programming solutions to algorithmic problems while forcing yourself not to look up solutions to help you would be good practice.

You need to be able to think through a plausible attempt at answers to questions you don't know how to answer, because you will continue to get pelted with questions you don't know how to answer without a couple hours looking through wikipedia, stackoverflow, or documentation, during interviews.

This is the #1 skill colleges are supposed to teach you (i like to think of the entire college experience as bullshitting 101, although this has more substance than just bluffing) but it doesn't always pan out that way. So, practice practice practice.

Even if you do start racking up leetcode answers, build something on your own from scratch that requires you to work outside your comfort zone and not directly follow any tutorial. If you want to rip your hair out you've picked a good problem. By this I do mean a complete standalone application relevant to the sub-field of CS you want to get into.

Also, hopefully you do know how to code by now, but if your coding skills are lacking, once again full projects are the best method of improvement (unless you're a beginner, then it's tutorials, tutorials on full projects, then full projects).

-----

Ok that handles problem 1.

Problem 2 is you need to memorize some explanations to pointless bullshit for pointless bullshit weeder questions. Do you need to understand interfaces? NO! (well you should but still no). What you need to do is feed the interviewer some bs rote explanation for what they are like you're a living embodiment of the textbook.

Is a good way to answer all questions? Of course not, but it's how you answer these nitpicky knowledge questions that are basically trying to test if you slept through class for 4-5 years.

If you keep getting stumped, try looking for online resources of popular questions and learning the answers (last interview I had I pre-memorized almost half the questions so this works distressingly well), and write down any questions you didn't know the answers to after failing.

Read up on those and try try again.

You don't need to answer every question, but ideally you don't want to flub all of these. It's not that the knowledge for these sorts of questions matters (arguable they should never be asked) but that you get the interviewer to feel good about you, by answering these questions confidently.


-----

So no one can really help you with problem 3, but try and find someone to help you practice interviews, and remember that faking is literally the same thing as making it.

Additionally, knowing the bullshit questions can make you feel better about the whole process. Practice taking a moment to get a deep breath and really think about every question. Not only does that help you, but most people like to see a steady measured approach to each question, combined with neither over nor under explaining it. So give a full explanation, then shut the fuck up no branching into your life story based on someone asking you what your experience is with X (yes people do this, so damn much dear god why).


Try dressing up real nice, overkill for whatever you think is expected by a little bit, make sure you shower and shave super well. Really ultra clean cut even compared to yourself dressing up usually.

Total anecdote but it helps me put on my bullshit confident sales-like persona.



Anyway, this is all my hot take based on personal experience and my general cynicism so grain of salt and all that. It isn't a very controversial set of statements though at least among the people I know."
"708","Practice, Practice, Practice. I had the same issue and the way I got around it was creating a blog. I would try to explain in the blog the concepts I didn't know. Remember, if you can't explain in simple terms then you don't know it well enough.

Start a simple pet project and explain to the most stupid people why you took each step this could help you understand your own logics, if you think you could have done it a better way, make the changes."
"709","Read Cracking the Coding Interview.    
[http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/)  


This should help clarify your understanding."
"710","Try some c++ oop.

You'll see why differentiating interfaces and abstract classes is useful.
And if you see that you'll know the difference forever.

My point is to try to apply your knowledge. Plenty of resources out there for that.

Think about the concepts and try to find examples for their use.

Try to make a point of differentiating similar concepts (types of polymorphism, for example).

That's how I try to study anyways. 

My gpa is mediocre but I do ok in interviews."
"711","Would you like to schedule a 1-1 via skype to talk about this?

I do interviews (on data structures, for applicants at my company) and ""How to tackle your coding interview""  talks at local universities."

I'm on a timezone that I think is the same as Boston massachusetts (Santiago, Chile)"
"717","Yup i PM'd you - I'm in central time, so I think I'm an hour behind"
"718","A lot of people fresh out of college can't do these things. This reddit has a terrible tendency of acting like everyone comes from MIT and works at Microsoft. It'll just take practice. And the best way to get that practice is at a job. I realize trying to get a job is your issue, but just remember that all you're studying for is to get a job. You don't have to worry about showing up to the job already perfect.

You need to make sure you can regurgitate dictionary definitions of the three pillars of OOP, and of Solid principles. You need to be able to go into detail about where you might make use of those. You need to understand arrays and linked lists and basic string manipulation. Hopefully you can at least discuss the basic pros and cons of binary trees and hash tables, but you don't need to be able to implement them. You probably don't even need to be able to actually *use* them. You won't get into Microsoft right out of college like that, but you can hopefully get your foot in the door."
"719","Start with something small like figuring out what a binary tree is. Then traverse it. Then explain it to someone who doesnt know what a binary tree is. Once thats complete, move onto the next data structure. 

Source: I dont know what the fuck data structures are but this is my plan when I am going to leave my company after a year or so."
"720","You're fine--maybe even in a better place than most--because you realize the problem. Now all you need is a solution. Which is not hard to come by. I'd recommend starting with the [Khan Academy Algorithms class](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms) and work your way through that at your own pace. When you're ready to move past that, try other material from the [Open Source University CS repository](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). 

&amp;#x200B;

No big deal"
"721","Thanks so much for those resources, especially the CS repo. Looks very comprehensive &amp; doable!"
"722","To be fair, it's really, *really* common to not understand abstract classes vs interfaces until you actually start developing. Everything you look up tends to spit out the same shallow facts that totally miss the mark, plus the same boilerplate ""iT's A cOnTrAcT"" verbiage without actually telling you shit."
"723","Hey man. As for OOP concepts, It would probably be very helpful for you to work on a project (website, desktop app, game, mobile app, or any kind of software) because having to use these concepts in projects and seeing examples of them implemented will help enforce these concepts and makes them harder to forget. When you use frameworks like the Android SDK for example, you will see how top engineers like the ones at Android use these concepts when building the frameworks. 

As for data structures (linked lists, arrays, BST etc. ), I found this playlist on YouTube by one of india's late top programmers ( humblefool ) where he explains them in a very nice way. The channel's name is: mycodeschool I am sure other channels have very good quality too.

All the best"
"724","Flunking interviews does not mean that you do not know anything. Success in interviews does not only depend on how well you grasp cs concepts. Sadly no school or University teaches how to be good at interviews. You have to be confident and trust what you know and do not know and what you want to know and what you don't want to know. You simply can't master everything as a new graduate and do not try to."
"725","Understand your DS and algos but I wouldnt say understanding interfaces vs abstract classes is important especially if you are applying for jobs that dont have these concepts. Coming from someone who doesnt use these concepts."
"726","Me neither yo, and I've been working in the industry for a year.

Can you give some more examples of questions that stump you? It could be that the questions you are being asked in interviews are more complex than you think.

Also, it might be that the questions are intentionally difficult. It's more valuable to an employer to know how you act when you DON'T know something than knowing that you can answer one question about a linked list or something."
"727","I work by myself so I've pretty much lost all the terminology. I just know how to program well, clean and efficiently while also being easy to understand."
"728","I'm the same and I already graduated last year. I think it's more because it was about minimal retention of the material and after finishing the class, it felt unnecessary afterwards. I'd say just go back to your homework and lectures from those classes and try to redo your assignments and everything until you feel like you've mastered them

But a lot of those things are more for programming and I just got a job in QA."
"729","I dont feel like I actually understood how to code until I started doing it for a living. Perhaps this is a practice thing(I was practicing more at work so I understood it more) . So my advice is pretty much the same as what I see. Just pick a language and start banging out coding problem. Maybe grab the cracking the coding interview book. You can find pirated versions on the internet for sure if you dont want to splurge for it but its probably be worth the money."
"730","Your professors have failed you. Go to the admissions office and ask for a refund for your parents."
"731","I recently graduated, and I think it's pretty natural that you'll forget a lot of the stuff you learned along the way. The only remedy is to review, and to keep working on things to refresh these concepts. Cracking the Coding Interview gives a good summary of the things you should know for getting-a-job purposes, and provides resources on where to go when you don't know/remember things. Keep in mind that CTCI is targeted at experienced engineers, and even they need reminders on this stuff. 

Really there is nothing to it but to just dive in, and keep going until you're competent. A good place to start would be to make a list of essential data structures and hit up resources (YouTube, your textbooks, various learn CS online sites) until you understand the What, Why, and How of each of them (and can implement from scratch). Next up, I'd say dive into LeetCode - you'll suck at first, but keep going! Applying your data structures and algorithms knowledge to actual problems will help you cement what you've learned."
"732","Well, donno how you made it so far, but congrats.

Personally, I don't consider OOP concepts like abstract classes vs interfaces ""fundamental"" at all. Abstract classes, interfaces, and all that stuff are only about organizing code. Useful in software engineering and maintaining large codebases, but nothing directly related with CS. IMO the only way to truly ""get it"" is to experience it first hand when you can no longer keep the logic of your few-hundred line school projects in your head.

As far as algorithms and data structures, just go grind [CTCI and Leetcode](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6rzl94/yet_another_help_im_drowning_post/dl9mrgg?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) properly."
"733","[deleted]"
"734","IMO these are far from good ideas to *learn* about data structures. The questions are meant to be ""hard"" (even the ones marked as easy). It's better to just look on youtube IMO someone who can explain the different data structures"
"735","I know he mentioned Data Strucutres but in my opinion that isn't going to help him learn OO principles like Abstract or Protected classes or interfaces etc.

I think this is bad advice you're offering because you're acting like the majority of companies ask Leetcode style questions. 


He should be able to explain Data structures and OO concepts in interviews which can easily be achieved by brushing up on the material and by practicing implementing them."
"736","I think those sites distracts genuine learners with a disguised sense of making ""progress"". Ambitious learners easily feel compelled to move fast with the complexity of the problems, or feel obligated to pass all tests."
"737","Everyone is ignoring the fact that this guy also said youtube videos. Learning theory and putting it into practice is the way to learn, which is what this guy is recommending xd"
"738","&gt; i'm almost done with my CS degree but I legitimately do not understand any data structures

lol how is that even possible? like let's say here's an array, it's a data structure... you don't understand how those work? not talking memory representation etc, just straight up array as a concept/programming language construct."
"739","Sounds like your degree was a waste of time/money."
"740","Why not stay in desktop software? Not everything can or should be browser based."
"741","I don't know... I saw an AWS whitepaper that said everything should be in the cloud."
"742","Big surprise, a cloud services company says everything should be in the cloud.

Even taking into account the massive growth of cloud based services, theyre not all web apps."
"743","Yeah no shit AWS would say that lol. Its called marketing."
"744","Sadly, too many jobs these days all involve cloud servers . But, there is nothing to say you cannot develop desktop software with a cloud back-end either.  I even think with the flaws of the modern web browser (that still has ancient HTML/JS technology) that people may one day migrate back to cross platform desktop apps."
"745","I mean most client-facing software is moving to the web. There really is no fighting it. So yes, whether you are backend or frontend developer, you need some knowledge of web development. Also, most software is legacy software rather than greenfield projects.  

Embedded might be a possible option I think."
"746","You definitely do *not* need web skills.

""Backend developer"" (data engineer, ML engineer, infrastructure engineer, etc., etc., etc.) is a thing for a reason.  

What you *do* need (to remain competitive in a generic sense) is the knowledge to work in ""the cloud"", i.e., with modern software.  This could mean that you know web dev skills...or it could mean that you're fluent/knowledgeable of how to build microservices, architect large, scalable data pipelines (e.g., Spark or Beam), large, scalable infrastructure (e.g., Kubernetes), etc.

No need to take my word for it...go look at job postings for non-frontend // non-fullstack roles; they will exclude Angular and all that jazz for a reason (i.e., specialization)."
"747","Sadly, in Nashville where I live I cannot find a damn thing that isn't cloud based job. I am utterly sick of this whole JS Clientside framework revolution.. Where people seem so married to a JS stack because they just keep breaking or one suddenly had a better idea and now the others just become obsolete and unsupported. As some said, front end dev is the Wild WEst, but it seems most jobs want you to be a back-end, front-end and web designer all-in-one.

I am thinking I will be leaving Nashville and see if I can find a city that has more back-end type jobs.  I think I can apply my desktop development skills to the back-end world more.  Most jobs are web jobs unless I want to get into low level device programming or stuff like that.  I am thinking about trying to hone me C++ skills again.  I have done quite a bit of C++ programming over the years.  

I am a .Net Developer , so the various Java frameworks I am pretty ignorant about.  I don't have so much time , but I would definitely like to pick up as much skills for back-end development as possible . I do feel the back-end is my passion.  I utterly hate HTML/CSS!  Having to intermix script with that crap just makes me go ill :p"
"748","&gt;To echo  [farmingvillein](https://www.reddit.com/user/farmingvillein/), I'm in Kentucky and a lot of the jobs I see are backend/infrastructure but are going to involve cloud services/writing web APIs. But not any front end JS stuff. I think you could position yourself pretty well for that kind of thing."
"749","Thanks for your response flight19.. You know I just posted a reddit post asking a question about a career more focused on cloud technologies, but sadly, it quickly went down the quagmire of cs career question posts, because I posted it late in the evening.. Nobody saw it. Here is the link.

"750","No. But its pretty easy to learn these web stacks. Some familiarity with them is fine when applying for new jobs. Programming is programming. If you master the basics its easy to pick up new languages."
"751","Focus on leetcode and nothing else because nothing else matters for FAANG"
"752","lol"
"753","Having canned STAR interview responses are pretty useful too"
"754","So fucking true. I wish I wouldve stayed on it for the past 6 months when I realized that I wanted to leave my company. I didnt even know what leetcode was until I BOMBED my first amazon OA"
"755","Learn C because C just came out last year"
"756","Don't stop leetcoding, because being able to pass interviews is peace of mind and freedom.

The rest of it will come through work, but continuing to do interview prep is something you'll forget after a few years and it's painful to get started again."
"757","I'd probably master C and with it every algorithm possible

master linear algebra and discrete math

those for a start"
"758","Why C? Why not C# or more high-level languages?

We will be taking discrete math soon and I will sign up for more math courses. I want to learn more about machine learning and AI, but it seems like you need a lot of experience in math."
"759","because, with C you are learning how to program right at the machine level, not how to use libraries and frameworks and pre-written routines, it is the nuts and bolts of logic that you can then adapt to absolutely anything that comes after

a good C programmer can learn how to program in C# quite easily, a C# programmer might have a lot of trouble trying to figure out C"
"760","&gt; C you are learning how to program right at the machine level

I am your future self telling your present self to learn both C and microarchitecture better."
"761","I mean when it comes to C-based languages it is the closest to machine level. You get less of the hand holding on memory management and access than you would from its derivatives"
"762","I never even thought of this. Ive hinged on a lot of c++ standard library to do my dirty work for me."
"763","Soft skills, dealing with other people with ""unique"" personalities.

Stress management, everyone will experience stress as early as College and that will continue through out your career. I've seen many people get burned out. I wish Colleges offer a course that help address stress."
"764","Start sooner. I started at 28"
"765","Data structures. Data structures. Data structures."
"766","Learn how to use cloud providers as well as possible, it is the future of backend (more like the present now)"
"767","&gt; Has anyone ever actually been able to make that pivot? Where thinking of everything and knowing what questions to ask actually comes naturally?  

I do not think it came naturally for me, rather I learned it. What you are essentially asking is how to perfect your Google-fu, because as a software engineer, you need to know how to find the correct information using the right search terms.  

I do not really have much advice except practice. Practice googling whenever you get stuck."
"768","Honestly, not even Google Fu, just getting to the point where it occurs to me that it's something I should Google, if that makes sense."
"769","For me a lot of times it's curiosity. If I hear some topic that I don't know much about and think it might be worth it to know or interesting, I'll google it."
"770","Go to school"
"771","Lol, got that down. Thank you"
"772","College"
"773","Well it sounds like you probably know quite a bit about building applications in .Net environments aside from just knowing C# you probably have some idea of how software projects are actually designed and built. Those engineering and architecture skills are what, in my opinion, really matters here and they're not language or framework specific. I feel pretty strongly that good engineers should be able to pick up a give tech stack with relative ease and the reason you hire them isn't because they're good at C# or JS but because they're good at solving problems.    


So I'd say sharpen your DS and Algo skills and spend some time reviewing things like design patterns, getting more in depth on a tech stack you already know pretty well is essentially locking yourself in to very specific roles. Google, Facebook, Amazon etc... don't hire people (except in very specific cases) who are Java, or PHP experts they know that you can easily pick up those language skills they hire people who understand CS and Software Engineering outside of the context of a single language or framework."
"774","I totally agree. But the way I see it. Regular companies ask questions which are mostly tech stack based. If I want to get a better paying job I will have to brush up my tech stack. 
BUT, if I want to get a really well paying job at big companies like amazon or netflix or something. I will have to dig into algorithms. I do not know if at this point i should even bother going that way. There are young lads who have been practicing algos throughout their term at college and after.  Of course Facebook wants to hire them. They are smart and young.  Me? I am about 30. I believe they would have mich higher hopes from me. They would probably expect someone with 7 yrs of experience to bring along solid technology stack knowledge as well."
"775","I worked for 4 years building .Net apps at a consulting company and came in as an mid level engineer to a Big N, I brought in my understanding of how to build systems but I had never written a line of code in the languages prevalent at my current company. Yeah I had to buckle down crack open some textbooks from college and implement a bunch of stuff I'd not seen in 6 years but it's without a doubt made me a better more well rounded engineer I also used Pluralsight's  architecture and design courses to better understand how to ""talk the talk"" for the stuff I'd been doing in my previous job.   


  
The best people on my team (our more senior engineers) came in at 30+ years old from a variety of backgrounds, games, consulting, etc... You have a ton to offer these ""top"" companies don't count yourself out because you think you're too old."
"776","Well thank you! That is encouraging. : )"
"777","Which pluralsight architecture and design course?"
"778","* Clean Architecture
* Encapsulation and SOLID
* Microservices Architecture
* Product Owner Fundamentals - Product Ownership from the Trenches
* Product Owner Fundamentals - Foundations of Product Ownership
* Design Patterns Playbook: Structural Patterns
* Design Patterns Library

I took all of those, some of them I just listened to while walking my dog or at the gym some of which I took sitting down taking notes.

There are probably newer courses on there that are also great."
"779","Cheers for this."
"780","Regular companies? Some unicorn-wanna-be (actually 2 of them) asked me to solve Boggle problem on the phone screening. Not even in house. Thats DFS plus Trie if you want to be precise. Some ask DP questions. And then they pay you half what Google does. So yeah. Regular companies are not so regular anymore. At least in NYC"
"781","I'm in a similar boat. I'm self taught, and my academic knowledge is severely lacking. Yet I can, and have built many applications. I did run through an algos/ds interview before, and with some cramming a few weeks prior, I think I did recently well (they told me it was a culture fit issue. I answered that I got into programming because it seemed like a lucrative career and with good benefits, they wanted me to say I've loved computers from the womb haha). 

So far I've done pretty well for myself. I've managed to rise up relatively quick into the six figure mark, but yeah that 200k+ is still a far away dream. However it does seem like the way to get there is to start getting better at the algos/ds stuff. 

I guess I'm comfortable now, but as things get better, it appears that you'll need more skills to stay relevant. At my first job, we had a very old intern, who had left the industry during the 2000 crash and got into real estate. It was around 2015, and he wanted to come back in. He was interning doing HTML+CSS psd -&gt; wireframe stuff. He knew absolutely no JS. However he told me at one point he was making around 100k, cranking out HTML +CSS documents.... I'm worried I'll end up like him"
"782","Why are you worried? Isn't 100k good? (genuine question since I don't understand foreign currency well)"
"783","For cscareerquestions? Nah. 
On a more serious note though, total comp for experienced devs is at least double that in the Bay Area."
"784","FAANG for sure, but total comp for experienced devs outside of those major companies in the Bay Area is more around $130k-$240k. I do realize the upper range is double what youve put down, Im just saying you see a lot more in the middle of that, like $140k-180k range, than you do these massive quarter million a year packages. Theres a lot of devs out here, and those packages are really competitive, so you get plenty of people settling for smaller offers from smaller companies too."
"785","For sure. Something else no one seems to talk about is that often the work life balance at big firms isnt too great. Yes youre working with the best, youre sometimes working on really dope projects, but they know that. And they work your ass off. Ultimately a good work life balance is more important to me. Outside of FAANG I think its relatively do about to hit the mid-high 100s and thats what Im shooting for in the next few years"
"786","Eh, I suppose I should've been more specific. By ""experienced"" I meant senior engineer, and they definitely make 200 here. Faang would be 300+."
"787","What?  Where exactly? Like in SF the city itself.  I mean even Glassdoor etc probably disagree with you."
"788","Tech is littered all over from SF to SJ, so wherever you live that is comfortable commuting to it.  Some (like FB) are opening offices in east bay too, so really just the entire bay area.

Glassdoor, I'm not sure why, is quite ridiculous in understating total compensation.  Levels.fyi is a much better, up-to-date, and accurate site for compensation values.  https://www.levels.fyi/?compare=Uber,Lyft,Apple,Facebook,Google&amp;track=Software%20Engineer"
"789","Ohhh, you're including RSUs, stock, etc.  Hmm... Will take a look at levels.fyi"
"790","oh. I see. So I guess I should be practicing algos and ds then?"
"791","This. Its not bad, Im going really well. Specially considering I have no debt other than a normal car. But I would eventually like to be making that super dough. But really I just wanna reach financial independence and I wanna retire early. The idea of sitting at a desk 8hrs a day for the rest of my life has me suicidal"
"792","&gt;The idea of sitting at a desk 8hrs a day for the rest of my life has me suicidal

Get a standing desk then."
"793","Let me rephrase, the idea of being inside during the best part of the day, giving up my healthiest years, and not doing the things I want to do (or limited to at best a few weeks a year) has me suicidal. The only way I see out is to increase my salary as aggressively as I can, and using that to achieve a position of being financially independent. Then its off to the mountains, and if I never have to write another line of code in an open office surrounded by marketers, well thatll be alright by me"
"794","Sorry, I was just making a bad joke, but I do get where you are coming from. There was a time where I would keep an empty box under my desk at work just in case I decided to walk out. I never did actually walk out of a job (I probably wouldn't have been able to afford to walk out), but it was nice to have that box there because it gave a false sense that I had some sort of control over my situation."
"795","No worries my dude! Damn that hit home. I feel that. May you be in control one day, best of luck"
"796","Lmfao"
"797","They meant back before the dotcom crash the person was making $100k doing HTML development.  In 2015 he was an intern trying to get back into web development."
"798","Yep. thanks for clarifying! Im already starting to see a bit of a similar trend with more traditional CMS- focused developers. Jobs seem to be shrinking(or theyre all sweatshop agency work), or they pay shit. Glad I left the Drupal-sphere"
"799","Need to find jobs in the microservices back end with go/java/python/nodejs or front end with react/vue. Those seem to be the hot ticket right now. Anything along PWA/web app development, especially react based UIs with nodejs, and golang is on the rise too for back end work."
"800","As someone who's far away from the US, the techs in demand (at least based on this sub) always surprise me. Here in Hungary (working for an international company, developing for other international companies though), in the enterprise space, GO, Python and Vue are not really a thing. Neither are back end and front end devs. What seems to be the safe bet is to learn full stack, specifically Angular + REST API in .NET or Java, and have at least a basic understanding of SQL (so be able to write fairly simple stored procedures for example). Even in a microservice architecture, you'll be usually given tasks in several modules which are built by using different techs.

Newer, small companies tend to offer front end or back end positions and there might be some jobs outside of the above tech stack, but if you want to chase the big money (without stepping on the entrepreneur route), then learning something like python is basically shooting yourself in the foot around here."
"801","I agree with Java or .NET on the back end for API development.. that seems to be the vast majority of choice as many rely on the longevity of those languages and the plethora of developers that know it. I don't know about Angular any more though for front end. Maybe to maintain an older app, but React and Vue seem to be by far the most in demand for front end work. I have also seen a few of that new web objects or whatever it is called. Not much though."
"802","Yeah pretty much nailed it. Id summarize that as you need to be developing applications not configuring premade content management systems"
"803","Oh shucks!"
"804","&gt; Regular companies ask questions which are mostly tech stack based. 

Not necessarily my experience, but anyway data structures and algorithms knowledge can help with language trivia too.  Like, how many .NET collection types can you think of?  A lot of people don't get a lot further than dictionary, array, and list, but there are tons of them, and their intended uses are more obvious if you've spent any time learning about data structures (like, why would you use a hashset instead of a list?  Easier to explain if you're familiar with the underlying concepts)."
"805","The big five don't care about your tech stack skills. Most of them have their own in-house tech stacks. They care about transferable skills like being able to build and maintain high quality software. Unfortunately, that's hard to evaluate at scale, which is why they ask algorithm questions.
If you think you are a good engineer, and you are good with people, go apply."
"806","I would counter that hiring managers don't know that the ability to architect real solutions is what really matters. No one cares what you can realistically build, if you can't inverse a tree structure in the smallest amount of time and do it using the one specific framework that they use and recognize. Though it may be different with people who have experience in many languages instead of being shoehorned for years on a single unchanging stack."
"807","I mean understanding how to inverse a tree demonstrates that you have an understanding of fundamental CS concepts, though if someone told me to do it in a specific language or framework I'd say that's pretty unfair. 

It's not hard to do coding interviews in language you don't write, a good candidate will be able to walk you through the code and the principles are so similar across modern languages it's pretty rare something comes out of left field. I typically have candidates pick a language their comfortable in and follow along from there."
"808","I've been an Android Developer for about 4 years now and 99% of the time I'm architecting solutions, not reversing a fucking tree. This sub places way too much value on ds/algo; sure, Google cares, but most other companies don't"
"809","The context of this was working at Big N or other large tech companies, because that's where I work and those are the interviews I conduct. I think a lot of people come in here and say ""you never use leetcode in real life"" but I certainly have run across the problems in my day to day, additionally while I spend most of my time building or architecting software and not worrying about run time knowing how to recognize a pattern I've seen before and solve it efficiently is important.   


It's not that reversing a tree is important to have memorized precisely, it's getting a bit of business logic realizing that it is under all the business logic inherently just inverting a tree or a moving window problem or a topographical sort etc... and understanding how to  solve that."
"810","It might demonstrate understanding, but it's also a skill that will not come up in any job after you graduate from university making it effectively useless to know. I've never seen a company willing to interview candidates that didn't already know the exact language they were hiring for; those with extensive experience in something else need not apply."
"811","&gt; but it's also a skill that will not come up in any job after you graduate from university

I've not found this to be the case, the interview question I use for onsite loops is actually something I solved on the job not long ago.   


&gt;I've never seen a company willing to interview candidates that didn't already know the exact language they were hiring for

Big N and other large tech companies hire for engineering roles regardless of language or tech stack background."
"812","&gt; etty rare something comes out of left field. I typically have ca

So you are saying I should be focusing on algos?"
"813","Yes, at least that worked for me"
"814","Cool. Thank you!"
"815","&gt; they're good at solving problems

Anyone want to provide input on this? Tech skills aside, how do i get better at solving problems?"
"816","Experience is usually the best teacher here, solving problems in this sense is the ability to:

* Interface with non technical teams and stakeholders,  
* Understand the problem that they are struggling with 
* Identify  the root cause, not just the symptom they are complaining about
* Then design and implement a technical solution to it.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a mixture of soft skills and engineering that you can read about in case studies but actually working on projects with other people is the best way to learn."
"817","very few places will hire you based on ""general software engineer skills"". if you look at most job posting, most of them require experience in a very specific set of skills. i'm running into a ton of rejection on my second job search because i don't have the exact literal years in the literal skills they want."
"818","Large companies tech companies usually don't care about specific language or stacks in my experience. That said you're right in that smaller companies or companies that have a lot of legacy systems will often look for specific languages or frameworks. I was speaking more in regards to OP wanting to work at a large tech company."
"819","What makes you not ""good"" enough to get in Google?

New Grads can even get in Google. 
You have 7+ years of experience. That's awesome. 
If you do desire to get in Google / FAANG, just grind leetcode problems. So, yes, you should start practicing DS and Algo if you're not content at where you are."
"820","&gt; grind leetcode problems. S

I am in a situation where I MUST make more money. Or things will start to fall apart in coming years. 

I am willing to do that grind. But just not sure in which direction. 
With 7 years of experience their expectations would be sky high."
"821","1. There are almost definitely junior engineers at Google who make more than you

2. You don't have to interview for a senior position. Yes, generally, 7yoe candidates get the senior loop. You are welcome to have an open conversation with your recruiter about how you may not have the experience to live up to a senior role. They would not mind slotting you for a mid level role."
"822","[deleted]"
"823","I've worked with junior devs at the age of 40 who made a late transition to CS. Also, you do realize that in any team, you aren't restricted to interacting with people at the same level? You're collaborating with people across all levels who will invariably come from a larger age range. It's not like all the senior devs put the junior devs on one kiddy project or some shit."
"824","Yep agreed. And I shouldn't use that as an excuse for not trying.
Thank you =
"
"825","Good luck!"
"826","&gt; I've worked with junior devs at the age of 40 who made a late transition to CS.

As an (almost) 40 year old transitioning to CS this took a weight off my chest."
"827","I've worked with junior devs and undergrad students that were in their 30s, had kids, etc. There's no limit."
"828","The idea is you have the experience already to get promoted faster, maybe you'll be a senior in two years.

It would be silly if the 22 year olds out-sped you in career growth :)"
"829","They wouldn't know. Level/title is not too easily accessible."
"830","Well you could always shoot for a lower level position within google. They probably pay pretty well.

&amp;#x200B;

Also get rid of this mentality that ""I may never get good enough to get a job at Google"". Being good at tech interviews is like 5% intelligence and 95% grinding Leetcode problems. Trust me, if you do enough of them you will start to see similarities between all the questions."
"831","You mean tech interviews at FAANG companies. Many others will have no leetcode problems"
"832","This is not true. I noticed even small companies in Greater Toronto Area start using HackerRank  pre phone interviews or on-site interviews. I think many companies have bought the idea that if FAANG hire this way it must be best way. But at the same time if you ask 95k oh that's too high for us."
"833","I have had plenty of interviews and have never had this. For large companies.

Worked at two of the largest fin tech companies in the US and didnt get it."
"834","That's encouraging. Thank you. I willing to do the grind. I was just unsure , in which direction.
I have just started out with a course on Udemy on ds and algorithms. Do you have any roadmaps or recommendations for me?"
"835","DS and algorithms course is nice, but nothing compares to just going to  [https://leetcode.com/interview/](https://leetcode.com/interview/) and just doing 1 assessment per day.

You have to really try on every problem (never quit before time is up). Even if you just get the brute force solution that's OK. After the problem is done, look at other submissions and try to understand why they are more efficient.

It's like going to the gym. You can read about different training programs but you won't see any progress unless you actually lift something.

&amp;#x200B;

And finally, figure out if you really want to work at FAANG. There are plenty of other companies that pay a lot of money and are easier to get into, especially with your experience."
"836","Who cares about FAANG as long as other companies pay very good money if not as much as FAANG."
"837","My man, thats the right attitude. Prestige doesnt fill my bank account"
"838","Agreed"
"839","what kind of non-FAANG companies give good compensation and are willing to hire Canadians?"
"840","[deleted]"
"841","I see your point, but I was specifically talking about those companies. There are other companies that offer similar benefits and packages, you just wont have the same bragging rights. For example there are some defense contractors paying out the ass, with good benefits, who also hire really smart people. So with that in mind, the only differentiator of a FAANG becomes prestige."
"842","Lmao. Imagine saying this about FAANG companies when Amazon is included in the list."
"843","This is the mindset I have adopted. Younger guy here looking to increase my salary as I also need to increase or things will fall apart. I don't really care about FANG and showing everyone how cool I am because of where I work. 

I just want that FANG kind of salary so I can take care of my family. I don't care if its at some place no one has ever heard of."
"844","&gt; Being good at tech interviews is like 5% intelligence and 95% grinding Leetcode problems

What about personal software projects? (And i don't mean copy and paste tutorial stuff) Can they replace a lot of Leetcode practice?"
"845","Personal projects will help you learn new frameworks and honestly are a much better indicator of software engineering skills.

But sadly, they won't help you with technical interview questions. It sucks because leetcode questions are rarely applicable to real software projects."
"846","They will help you get past the resume screen but not the interview. Many FAANG interviewers dont even look at your resume."
"847","r/financialadvice and r/personalfinance may help the underlying issue"
"848","It depends which role and seniority you apply for. 

If you approach it like a career transition (from corporate IT to Engineering), it may help you develop a study plan and frame your experience during the interview."
"849","No, a faang will ""downlevel"" you (aka, put you at the appropriate level) if you get an offer. You'll interview at L4 level for Google, even if there are people there at L5 with 5 years of experience. 7 years of experience at small scale is not the same thing as in faang. They may even downlevel you to L3. That'll be good since you'll make more than you do now, though being same level as new grad will kind of suck after a while.

But if you get in, you won't have 6 months to dick around learning how to write unit tests or design a basic piece of software. You should already know that part."
"850","That's probably very true."
"851","&gt;With 7 years of experience their expectations would be sky high.

You have 7 years working experience and after that you started working with the basics. That seems impressive enough. Don't get discouraged, they aren't the most difficult topics. If you really want to learn you will have to exercise though, because if you don't you will easily forget the stuff. The idea isn't that you are the master of DS or algorithms, but to have a better grasp of what things you can do. In the event that you ever need to use any of the tricky stuff you learn in such courses, you can just google about it. The thing is that if you didn't know anything about it in the first place, would you know what to look for? 

That goes for every single foundation course on a CS major, systems software, computer architecture, networks, operative systems, databases, programming language design, software engineering, compilers, security, etc.

You don't need to be the master of anything, but it is extremely useful to know what tools you have as a software engineer.

&amp;#x200B;

All of that being said, I would encourage to start with DS and algorithms. Do it at your own pace, maybe a chapter of CLRS every two weeks, focus on understanding what is going on, do a little implementation, and try to find when those things you learn about could be useful.

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck. And just FYI, if you ever pass the online code challenge for a software engineering position, a coding interview is just you showing the other person in the room that you can communicate your ideas, you can ask questions and that you know the basic tools to solve a problem. The idea of a problem isn't to fuck you, it is a framework for you to show how competent you can be (and of course, questions are allowed, an interview is not a paper quiz)."
"852","..."
"853","No not because of any woman. But because I have a sister who has severe autism. She needs constant looking after and my mom is not getting any younger. I need to be able to hire a full time maid or something. If not now then in a couple of years."
"854","Sorry to hear this! Good luck with your efforts!"
"855","The best option then is to attempt to break into one of these really big companies, do what's needed to move up or move up by switching jobs, and target an office that's not in a super expensive location if possible

If money is what you want, FAANG is the safest bet (taking into account how hard it is to get into anywhere that pays more, or that some companies who pay more don't have public stock)"

He studied a long time for the interview, but he himself explains that you don't need a long time to be ready. I'd say grind Leetcode for two months and then try and if you fail learn from your mistakes and keep trying."
"857","Thank you man! I needed this article. Thank you so much. :)"
"858","Glad it helped you :)"
"859","Depends on where you want to work, if it's a Faang company then spending time on ds and algo along with scalable system design would be the best way to spend your time. I'm sort of from a similar background as you .NET developer, except not as much experience. 2.5 years and never learned ds and algo. I went through the process of self teaching python and ds and algo and trust me that having experience helps a ton in terms of understanding the concepts. I feel that i picked up the concepts a lot quicker than say someone learning it for the first time in college just because of my work experience. Also with 7 years of experience faang companies will have system design rounds so would also look into studying that in parallel if you want to get started. Feel free to message me if you want more info on how to dive into some of this stuff if this is the route you chose to go."
"860","Thank you ! : )"
"861","\+12 years here, enterprise software mostly, I only practice a bit before interviews.

other than that, I try to apply what I learn whenever I see the opportunity, for example right now I'm changing our synchronous reporting service to an async model using message queuing and push-pull notifications, first time doing this but  i've read enough to feel confident"
"864","Thanks for sharing the links =M"
"865","&gt; Or should I spend my time on learning algorithms and stuff? I do not have a lot of free time on my hands so I can not pick both.

It's a good bang for your buck to learn the most common/""classic"" algorithms and data structures.  You can spend a week or two and have a lot of the most important and useful knowledge you need to apply to various applications.

It's the kind of thing that sticks around abstractly in your brain as well, not like forgetting syntax that happens almost immediately when you're not using it."
"866","I'm also a self-taught guy who was working before I studied any of the theory.  You should absolutely do it.  It'll really make a difference in the way you approach problems and the kind of problems you're able to solve.  Plus, data structures and algorithms today look very similar today to the way they did decades ago.  Who knows how popular .NET and angular will be in a decade or two?  That knowledge will apply to any language you choose to work in."
"867","I guess if nothing else, learning  ds and algorithms may atleast ensure that i will have one less thing to worry about when preparing for job change"
"868","Any time you've encountered a problem where your app is running too slow, or the code feels a bit cumbersome, there's a good chance that a stronger grasp of data structures or algorithms would help.

Absolutely yes, you should learn them.

And just like anything else that is hard to do, it will feel at first like it's just not your thing, but practice and exposure will make it a bit easier over time and eventually, second nature."
"869","Do you have any roadmaps? Any recommendations? 
I have just started with a course on udemy on ds and algorithms"
"870","I highly recommend the Harvard CS50 course. It is an introductory Computer Science course that covers data structures, algorithms, and a lot of basic computing knowledge that you usually just miss out on if you are self taught, like I was, and like I'm guessing you are.

All of the lectures are freely available online, and they are very high quality, as one would expect from Harvard."
"871","Yes.I am self taught. 

I am so gonna be watching it.  Thank you so much."
"872","30 is not even old for CS careers. I think thats the majority age range for any senior engineer which can be considered somebody with 4-7 years of experience. Algorithms and data structures is what makes you a software engineering, throwing together code because you know a framework just means you know how to throw things together. Understanding how they work and why they work AND being able to implement it (even if it means having to lookup the syntax or documentation) is what differentiates engineers and scientists from code monkeys. Put in the time to improve you engineering skills rather than code monkey skills.

Think of it as comparing a hacker to a script kiddie. Congrats you can follow instructions on how to run other peoples scripts or use tools developed by others on Kali Linux. But do you understand what theyre doing and why? Thats what makes you valuable"
"873","Agreed. I think i should dive into ds and algorithms. Someone on Reddit has even suggested that i should learn C language. Because languages such as C# hide the good stuff. It might take me forever since I have a full time job"
"874","C is a great language to learn because you understand more of the process happening. Funny enough its easier to read that languages like java or but not funny when you have to write 10x as much to do things that java and Python can handle in one or a few lines. But its the difference between knowing what youre doing and getting something done"
"875","I see. I guess I will be wandering at udemy and pluralsight looking for C courses"
"876","Balancing work and self education is difficult so make sure to set yourself up a schedule and stick to it so you can balance work, family and self studying. 

People just like you have managed to improve and get into google from nothing in 6 months. Saw some stories on Leetcode of electrical engineers with minimal programming skills able to do it, so you can too. Learn the theory of data structures and algorithms, and put it to use in leetcode! Theres a learning curve for everything but if youve made it this far in CS, you can surely continue."
"877","Thank you. I guess I did the right thing posting this on Reddit."
"878","&gt; Someone on Reddit has even suggested that i should learn C language.

Do not spend your time on learning C if your goal is to end up in a job that pays the big bucks. It is definitely a great language to learn to become a better programmer, but it's hard to interview in. It's all about grinding leetcode to get into companies that pay top dollar. I would stick to C# since you already know the language and focus on the DS&amp;A part. Most companies will let you pick the language you want to interview in as long as it is not something obscure. Python, Java, C# and JavaScript are most people's go to."
"879","If you want to learn a language that forces you to write memory safe stuff, learn Rust. Lots of folks are starting to use it in production too. There's also sane B-tree implementations in Rust too, unlike C. =
"
"880","This is exactly where I am. 7 years of work experience, but my degree was in EE, so I never really took the harder programming classes in school. My problem is, work just doesn't feel fulfilling unless I'm being challenged, and I don't want to stagnate. So personally, I've been working on them just to broaden my understanding, and cross my fingers that maybe someday it'll lead to an opportunity."
"881","Best of luck mate."
"882","Google will focus more on system design if you have more experience"
"883","How do you learn or improve upon that? Any recommendations? Links?"
"884","Im not sure if someone else has recommended it, but [The System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) on GitHub is a great resource."
"885","Thank you. I was not aware of it."
"886","https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRPMAqdtSgd0Ipeef7iFsKw This guy's channel is good.  But don't get the wrong idea, you'll still want the DS/A knowledge too"
"887","Thank you for sharing that link.
I will look into ds and algos first before diving into  system design"
"888","Yes, but they will most certainly require their senior engineer to master DS&amp;A as well."
"889","You should know basic data structures and basic algorithms. They're not hard to learn, especially with the resources available today. You can learn for like an hour a day or just 3 days of the week. Within a month you'll be sailing.

 As a Jr dev when I look at legacy code at my firm, some of it is just widely inefficient. Like nested for loops galore. I got tasked for a few months optimizing/refactoring old legacy code and it was a bit painful. Team leads were surprised at some of the optimization gains in some parts of the product and I was like ""I just copy/pasted some algorithm"" and they nodded.

Good example was when our client started to send millions of requests DAILY. Typically our product only had to deal with at most 200K requests in a day and that was the extreme. Shit broke so fast. Took months to find all these inefficiencies and bad stuff. Our product is meant to be distributed but it's not scalable at all (YIKES). So we implemented some async libraries to deal with the requests and shit got so much better."
"890","The thing is after a point, you are anyway good at those things without remembering all those algorithms about how you can find the largest sum in an array without using constant space in 45 mins. In real life therere more variables than those tech rounds. 
Its obvious that you should know about complexities in general, however, it should not be just to clear those interviews. Learning about those things in start of your career make sense, but when youre already 7+ years, you should be spending this time in learning higher level things which can improve your productivity directly. That doesnt mean you still write code that runs for O(n^2) in production (whos reviewing those PRs)."
"891","Here's a datapoint for you: 34 yrs old. Worked at xyz large enterprise software company for 5 years, which is my only experience in software (entered the field late).

Decided to systematically approach studying for interviews about 8 months ago (1 or 2 hrs a day, top ranked leetcode problems plus about half of Cracking the Coding Interview). Last month I received two FAANG offers.. accepted one for 250k compensation plus 20k signon.

10/10, would recommend, doubled my income, wish I would have done this 2 years into my career instead of 5. BTW, I was not accepted for some super-senior position at all... Just one notch above new grad hires."
"892","Thanks for sharing this.. it helps."
"893","Let's talk a bit about the meaning of the word 'experience'. I'm borrowing a line my wife used in teaching advanced motorcycling. Many of her students would frequently report, ""I've been riding for 15 years"". When the riding part of the course, taught on a closed racetrack, would begin, of course the ""15 years experience"" riders were doing the worst. The line she would ask students to consider during the classroom prep for the track was, ""Do you have 15 years of experience, or do you have 1 year of experience repeated 15 times?""

Someone's who's just been riding on Sunday down to the coffee shop isn't learning new skills or improving existing ones because they are not challenging themselves.

Taking the bot mot over to software development -- I'd expect after 7 years you should already have figured out the common data structures, out of necessity and exposure in code written by others. 

There are going to be gaps, however, things like rarely used structures or algos that aren't obvious derivatives of other ideas. Even if you never use one directly, often you can find yourself adapting facets of the knowledge to other problems.

You don't have to enroll in a course to learn. There are popular comp-sci books that either have hundreds of ""recipes"" in them, or professional papers like ACM proceedings, and many technology companies have corporate subscriptions that grant unlimited access to their catalogs. Maybe spend two 30-minute sessions per week over coffee or tea or whatever your stimulant of choice browsing. You don't need 100% comprehension, just file away the knowledge that such-and-such exists and you know where to find it if you need it.

Written by a 35-years experience senior engineer, self-educated. (Maybe 20 years of actually doing new stuff in different types of software)."
"894","You cannot work as a software developer without using Data Structures or Algorithms. Since youve been using them the whole time, perhaps all you need is the terminology."
"895","It's better that you pick the topic that you're more likely to stick to. Make it a secondary goal that you actually enjoy yourself, because if one topic ends up being a total grind then you will quit. 

With exercise, the 'best' exercise is the one you like enough to stick with. Likewise, I think best topics for self-study are the ones you find to be most interesting.

Try a little of both, and whichever one you enjoy more--stick with that one."
"896","Sounds reasonable. Thank you."
"897","Yes its definitely worth learning some of the basics"
"898","I'm not sure where you live, but in my state, .Net developers are in high demand and their pay is above average. Most companies here don't do the LC style interviews, they're more interested in your relevant experience, and side projects/open source contributions if they're pretentious. The cost of living in my state is also fairly low."
"899","I am doing okay with .net for now. But the idea is to do much better. (Better than most companiy)"
"900","I understand. I'm kind of in the same boat, except with 6 yoe. I would recommend giving some deep thought on your goals and what it is you actually want to achieve. 

Personally, I want to be in a position where I have most of my expenses paid off and I can work a comfortable job doing something I enjoy, like teaching or making art.

Since I make decent money at my current position and my cost of living is very moderate, I could achieve that goal within 7 years or less. But I hate where I live and I want to relocate some place nicer. So if I make some sacrifices, I can probably relocate and get a higher paying job, but ultimately sacrifice my long term goal and put it off an additional 6 years minimum.

What are you after? If it's money &amp; quality of life, you can get more money by moving somewhere like Texas, get a 6 bedroom house for under $200k and a sweet gig that pays you close to 6 figs to pay off that house in no time. But if you dont like Texas, or you're after a status boost, that's another story :P

Anyway, best of luck to you! Feel free to reach out, I don't find many industry experienced people who are looking to study algos &amp; ds with me."
"901","I've noticed the same thing in my area. A lot of jobs looking for a combo of C#/.NET and some JS framework."
"902","This is SUPER me right now...like, WTF can I offer the top tech firms? Im just a AWS/cloud/node/react/security/terraform/DevOps/networking/IT generalist...I dont know my graphs from my tries, but, I have shipped code used at F100 companies and worked on 30m dollar projects...k8s at scale? Not like google, but Ive dabbled...they wont hire me if I cant balance a binary tree or do graph traversal off the top of my head..."
"903","Well, I literally failed my Amazon interview because I couldnt write DFS search on a Graph fast enough and I didnt know how to heapify a min-heap.

And yeah, I was working on a 70Mn project when I was interviewing for them. It doesnt matter at all."
"904","Well they have to come up with interviews that are fair to people from smaller companies. More money doesnt mean better."
"905","I think they value how fast you can solve a problem more because that is something that can be measured in a limited interview time frame. It's not like they will ask us to spend a couple of weeks and if they like us we are hired."
"906","If you want to get a job at Google... yes. This is because the notorious Google interviews are heavy on Datastructures.

But please note that studying Datastructures and algorithms on websites such as leetcode, some people find it extremely sole crushing and demotivating. It might not be worth degrading your passion for programming.

So please take these 2 points into account."
"907","I agree that its really demotivating preparing for those interviews, especially when youre already doing well in your job. You know enough data structures and algorithms that is needed for you to do your job.
This is a really terrible way to judge a candidates skill IMO."
"908","Good, I'm not the only one."
"909","600+ upvotes and no answer. You really shook the waters here."
"910","To preface this - I've got about a decade of experience, and I spent about eight years of that writing .NET applications of varying size/complexity. I also have a CS degree, albeit a long time ago.

While having an in-depth knowledge of DSA is useful in your day-to-day job as a developer, I truly believe that you can go through your entire career not knowing anything about **standard** DSA.

The reason I say standard is because whether you know it or not, you're already using many of the standard structures, but are using them within the .NET standard library. You're already aware of dictionaries, lists, linked lists, hash sets, the different sorting algorithms at play within the framework. You've probably also run into code where someone is using multiple foreach loops to go through a nested collection to find something, and have had to rewrite that code to be more efficient.

I recently decided to jump on the DSA/LC bandwagon, because I felt that I didn't know as much as I needed, but to be honest you're probably not as far off as you think you are. It's always worth learning how your chosen language/framework deals with things like sorting - for example when it chooses to use merge sort or when it chooses to use quicksort, but ultimately that's what you'll be learning. You'll be refreshing your knowledge in a different context.

As for getting a job at Google, while I don't work for a big tech company, one thing I will say is that they clearly value people with experience in multiple languages. During my eight years writing .NET code, I didn't get a peep from any Big N recruiters, but the second I threw Ruby and PHP on my CV I had recruiters from Amazon and Facebook contacting me regarding roles. The point I'm trying to get across is that it's not necessarily a skill thing - it's how you sell yourself."
"911","What would you do if you have to get a much higher paying job than the one you have right now?"
"912","Is contracting an option for you? It's all dependent on stack/location, but in some areas contractors can make a tidy sum."
"913","IMO Contracting is not that stable.I need a steady income."
"914","I went over 20 years and never did...  Now I do.  Really depends on if you're going to be in the job market or not.

I'm guessing the big thing now is to switch jobs more often, so it's probably best to do them once in a while so you're not 100% rusty on them.

The thing is that if you don't use them, you'll get a bit rusty later, but the memory will come back with some refresh."
"915","What is your tech stack? And what kind of softwares do you make?"
"916","What I do now is all mobile from enterprise software to regular mobile apps.  I haven't put any apps out yet.

I use Apple's iOS, Objective-C and Swift.

Part of the goal is to build specialized business software that works on iPhones.  So far, the only back end work is with the pre-packaged setups like Realm/Firebase and some custom NodeJS.

My background is in custom business software that would run on a client server setup like a MS SQL server, now I'm moving those apps over to a mobile platform.

Another part of the goal is regular over the counter mobile apps."
"917","IMO DS&amp;A skills become less and less important as technology gets cheaper and more powerful...  
And if you're perfectly happy making .net applications you will probably never need to know this stuff.  


However there are jobs out there that probably pay better that require some serious number crunching. Those jobs are probably going to require knowledge in that area.  


So I guess at the end of the day it's about where you want to go in your career.  


Personally I suck at math and hate working too deeply in it. I have numeric dyslexia so it's easy for me to make small mistakes in math and algorithms. So I know I won't be happy in those positions. even with the higher pay. But it's up to you."
"918","Well as long as you are content, nothing else matters."
"919","&gt;IMO DS&amp;A skills become less and less important as technology gets cheaper and more powerful...

This is completely true.

If someone throws up an MR where they've implemented their own sort to sort an array of Strings, I am going to kick it back to them and tell them to use the language's \`.sort\` method.

There are still cases where DS&amp;A are important - performing operations on huge data sets comes to mind; but even then, there are usually libraries with implementations of every algorithm you might need, and DS&amp;A knowledge becomes more about understanding when to use which tool, rather than knowing how to build each tool themselves."
"920","As someone that has also spent most of their career in the .Net ecosystem. Focus your time and attention on being a better developer instead of being so focused in one tech stack.  Google and StackOverflow exist to help with syntax of how to do something. The bigger issue is knowing how to best make something possible."
"921","So what does 'rising up' mean to you? I get the sense you think its not possible without doing leetcode somehow? Does it mean working for a FANG company? Making more money? I can tell you that you can make a ton of money never doing leetcode type interview questions."
"922","Making money. But at the same time, sticking to coding. I do not want to become a manager."
"923","Keep in mind that yes, the FANG companies offer higher salaries. But they are also in high COL areas. No reason, if you are good, that you can't make $140k+ in a medium COL area after 4+ years, possibly even more (I'm sure there are examples here that could chime in) without doing leetcode."
"924","It depends which direction you want to take your career in - and it sounds like you do have that choice. I work heavily in simulations so for me personally I find algorithms to be one of those things where it can make you a better developer in certain scenarios, but you can't use them if you don't know about them in the first place.

For instance, if I am faced with a new problem, I might think about it differently if I have a solid, prior understanding of algorithm X or Y. Otherwise, ignorance is somewhat bliss - but the final product might not be as optimal.

Again, I'd say it really depends on what you want to focus your career on. You certainly don't need A&amp;DS for everything"
"925","&gt; ay it really depends on what you want to focus your career on. You certainly don't need A&amp;DS for

I have a question. And I need you to answer it honestly. 
Do you think someone can get better at solving algos? 
I mean I do understand that if you have a fair understanding of certain topics then it becomes easier. But after that, do you get better? Some people are naturally very good at it. Others not so much. I say this because there was this algorithm that took me an hour to solve. While my friend solved it within 20 minutes. I have never been in the habit of solving puzzles. So I have zero practice. He has been doing it off and on for 2 years. But I doubt if it has to do with that. I think he is just relatively smarter than me in that regard."
"926","&gt; I say this because there was this algorithm that took me an hour to solve. 

As long as you are making progress, you are progressing. Do we get better? If we stick at it, yes. I wouldn't directly compare against your friend about ""time to understanding"". Some people take longer to grasp something *but once they know it, they know it very well*.  
Like many things in software, we learn best by doing. Find code that utilizes some algorithm to produce a thing. Be it bucket sort, breadth-first search, recursion vs iteration, or whatever the algorithmic flavor of the day is. I'd implement it myself, see where I struggle and just try to grasp the theory together with the implementation details. After that you might spot patterns in places where it might be applicable, and the fun begins..."
"927","&gt;Some people take longer to grasp something but once they know it, they know it very well.

The people who learn things more quickly are usually the people who have an easier time recalling/relearning them, too. There is no tradeoff here."
"928","I will take your advice. Thank you =
"
"929","It's practice mate. Think of all the people in the world who are excellent at what they do, and now think of how many of them got there without thousands of hours of hard work and failures. Anybody who is *sufficiently motivated* is capable of learning interview-scope DS&amp;A."
"930","I agree. There is no substitute to practice. It was just that I wanted to be sure I practice the right stuff. There os an ocean out there. You can't learn it all. You will have to focus on one section."
"931","I wrote bubble-sort algorithm within a month of learning to program without realizing I had written it until after the fact. This was in February. I started in January. 

I had been grinding those coding websites for 2 - 3 hours before I came across the problem where I accidentally wrote the algorithm. I started off not even knowing how to approach a problem  this looks like a previous problem. Its all pattern recognition and you develop a bag of tricks for problems.

I havent even started learning DS &amp; Algos yet (starting in April). Take this from somebody who used to think getting better at that stuff was impossible, you can become better. Just practice."
"932","I'm the same. I'm actually older than you and currently doing leetcode in my spare time (certainly not grinding though, don't understand how that would be helpful).

Best of luck!"
"933","Thanks. And best of luck  to you too."
"934","Sounds like me, haha. Although, I plan on going a different route--self employment"
"935","I already tried, doesnt work. It requires talking to people ="
"936","Do you mind sharing your current salary range? I'm curious as to where your data point stands in the great debate about the importance of theoretical understanding and career progression."
"937","I am a 9+ years experience Full stack engineer. I have worked on almost the full spectrum of platforms and languages (Games, Android, iOS, Windows Phone, BB, Node.js, Go, .Net, Python, Unity3D, Jenkins, AWS, GCP,  Kubernetes, Angular, React and many more). I was told that my resume is pretty impressive. Due to that I got called into interviews by Google (twice) and Amazon (thrice) both in 4 different countries for their on-site rounds. 
Despite all of this, I cant clear any of the on-site rounds, because I have never studied those Algorithms and Data Structures. I am a MBA in Finance, I was never taught any of that and none of my employers ever mind my lack of knowledge about those, because I am quite good at my job.
This time its Facebook, I am giving my last try there next week and trying to focus more on these interview problems which most probably Ill never need in my job. Its a waste of time, effort and energy for me, and honestly I am pretty happy with my current job. Its just that I dont want to miss the opportunity to see how these companies work with the unimaginable scale. How is it that they dont break things often and many other things to quench my curiosity.

If I could suggest you anything, itd be that its not really required to be in FAAAM to be successful in Software engineering, unless you have curiosity like me or if youre after the money they will pay.
Whatever is your reason, its not impossible for people like us to get there. It just requires some efforts. Ive started doing that for last couple of years and its still a long way to go for me (they add those system design interviews for senior positions which are much harder to crack, even if you have designed such systems).

If you think its worth it, you should give it a try. Its not hard to get an interview there. If you are good, theyll notice you sooner or later, but start preparing from now, otherwise youll have to get rejections for few times."
"938","With 7 years, I'd say you are probably good in terms of using the various technologies. If you do want go to for it, definitely study the data structures and algorithms! With just a bit of grinding and your experience, I'd say you've got this in the bag!"
"939","Go ml.net hardcore. Using two models in production and it works great. Can't recommend it enough"
"940","Always be learning.  It's as simple as that.

If you don't, one day you will wake up without the ability to get a job as a software engineer.  You'll probably blame it on your age, but really it's because tech moved on and you didn't move on with it.

If you're ambitious and like a bit of fun, I recommend [SICP](https://github.com/sarabander/sicp).  It's MIT's old CS101 class, and it's legendary.  The lectures on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J_xL4IGhJA&amp;list=PLE18841CABEA24090) are fantastic too, but you'll want to turn on CC for the few places the tapes have warped.

SICP set MIT on the map, and anyone who has taken it will still recommend it today.  The first chapter in the book has tree structures and recursion in it.  It's a bit ambitious, but it will push you into the deeper parts of data structures in one week, instead of one semester."
"941","Also with 7 years of exp youre no longer entry level at google. Which means there will be a big design component in your interview"
"942","I think at your point having project management experience, development and deployment knowledge and awareness of development principles as well as the patterns are more important that leetcode."
"943","Yes . Never stop learning.   

My advice is to go into the C deep end.  C underpins almost everything.   Manual memory allocation will also drive home the importance of data structures.

C#, .NET, angular ... that's all a distraction from the good stuff.


Perhaps your brain isn't wired for this stuff.  But you need to realize that it isn't out of your reach.  Do it already"
"944","Dive into C? You are practically asking me to dive into a Sea. Lol.  Hiw about C++ ?"
"945","C++ is C with a mountain more stuff.

C has very few parts to it.  But it can make things more verbose, long winded.

C also will be quicker at resetting your views on memory (important) since C++ continues with the idea of objects.

C is one of those languages where once you understand it,  you can do anything.  Yes it might seem like a huge sea,  but once you learn to swim, you'll wonder what all the fuss was about."
"946","Piquied my curiosity. I am searching C on udemy right now."
"947","I built out a project in C. My understanding of how memory works increased drastically after doing so. Everything is in manual in C."
"948","I think I know what to buy next on udemy"
"949","Just bought it"
"950","Nice. Lots of aha moments ahead.   I'm very glad I stuck with it.  IMO, no better way to learn than writing code and failing :).

IMO the coolest part is seeing that all these variables and objects in your program are just numbers sitting at a memory address. Variables and structures are just memory offsets into that memory that the compiler sets up for you.  ""There is no ~~spoon~~ variable ...""  hehe"
"951","I wouldn't dive into C unless I want to work in IoT. I would recommend C++ as you still need to understand the underlying x86\_64 architecture and memory management. But C++11 is still being used in high-performance backend applications today so it has some applicability."
"952","   I really do think there is value is learning C before moving to C++.  IMO c++ hides important memory concepts/lessons.  I'm not suggesting he then uses C for everything."
"953","&gt; My advice is to go into the C deep end.  C underpins almost everything.   Manual memory allocation will also drive home the importance of data structures.

If this aint gatekeeping I dont know what is."
"954","You moron, you cropped out my last 2 sentences.

If this aint trolling I dont know what is."
"955","I am pretty sure you have never written a production software in C. Youre in for a surprise."
"956","C/C++ is my day job, buddy ;)"
"957","Have you tried instead of him watching you work through an issue, you watch him work it through? My boss did that with me to help me learn and it helped A TON. He sat there and watched, and when it was clear I was stuck, he'd pose a question that would nudge me in the right direction without telling me how to do it. Things like ""Okay, what do we know? Don't know? How do we find out?"" and the like. I hope this made sense, and I hope you guys get past this!"
"958","Most definitely agree with this. Would also add to watch HOW he solves problems if he even gets to that point in the first. You need to know what his deficiency is before trying to apply corrective measures. Might not even be a problem with his critical thinking and more a confidence issue where he panics when something breaks.

TL;DR Be observant as well when you're coaching him with the other suggested method and note patterns you pick up."
"959","This is because questions are more important than answers to the skill of critical thinking."
"960","Thank you, this is some good perspective I needed to hear. I think I've let the pressure of deadlines get to me too much in these conversations. But he's going to be far more productive (and happy) down the line if I take my time with him now, instead of thinking I can quickly fix this one issue and he'll somehow figure it out next time."
"961","Along the lines of what he's saying, I don't know if your company does pairing but you should bring it up. Paired programming why my principal devs skyrocketing my ability and knowledge, both while driving and navigating."
"962","Create runbooks and have him write shit down. There's a chance that he's just overwhelmed with the system and when something breaks will just start panicking, flailing wildly and nothing works.

Start asking ""what have you tried so far"", then pointing him the right direction or at the correct runbook then letting him work for 20-30 minutes before checking on him.

If he's still straight up incapable after all of that, that's a problem and bob may have to find a new job."
"963","Thank you, this is great advice. I think both the idea of physically writing out some runbook procedures, and asking him to lead the debugging conversation, will both really help here."
"964","You have to let him struggle. At then end of the day if you want him to anything more than copy pasta code monkey you need him to struggle, and you need to recognize he's going to take way way longer than you and other's to get really anything done.

I ween interns and new grads off me pretty fast from code and environment specific questions. I set the boundary that you only talk to me when you don't understand either an architecture issue i.e how service A talks to B, or 2. You can make literally 0 progress on your issue, you've tried everything and given up. On 2. I always ask what they tried and if I think they could try other ways I suggest that. If that still fails then comes the good part. I love helping people out so I like this part, now I do what others have said pair program through a problem, I show them how I use a debugger, read documentation, search online, explore tools to understand the problem better.

At the end we solve the problem together I rubber duck off them to explain my thought process and let them disagree with me, many times their wrong but sometimes they're right, and it's awesome when they are but that's not the point I want them to see how I think and I want to see how they think so I can show them themselves where they might have flaws in their assumptions, many times I add leading questions so they can figure out the problem themself rather than me finding it for them.

Alot of times especially with those who got good grades they're really scared to be wrong and the majority of the time I'm just there teaching them that that's we do all day make mistakes till we figure out the problem. Other times its they need to up their critical thinking skills which the pair programming solves, other times they just need to learn how to be self sufficient and figure out how to use all the tools at their disposal to successfully do their job which is why I let them struggle.

Overall though be kind and nice, don't ever be dismissive, if for any reason you make some scared to fail, take risks, or ask questions thats when the real issues start occurring and that can be hard to break."
"965","Your approach sounds like the one my research advisor takes. Good leadership like that is how you build an excellent team from first principles. Give someone some code, you help them for a day. Teach them how to generate the process themselves, and you set them up for a lifetime of success."
"966","A lot of good insight here, thank you. Especially about people who did well in school being afraid to fail in the field -- That describes Bob pretty well. It's been a minute since I was in school, so I forget that the finality of *turning something in* can make people really commit-shy once they get into a job."
"967","It's possible he's scared to mess up. To the point where he doesn't want to try when the issue is outside his immediate knowledge base.

Some of the other suggestions here seem good too. I would try and let him figure it out himself sometimes (assuming the problem isn't very urgent). Or just nudge him in the right direction without outright doing it for him. Let him know that it's okay to interrupt you if he gets stuck."
"968","I think you're enabling him. If he learned how to code he can figure how to troubleshoot problems. I mean if you're given a regular compiler and a magical compiler that fixes syntax/logical errors which one would you choose? You're his magical compiler."
"969","I think you're exactly right. I'm going to take the time I was spending on fixing his issues, and have him lead debugging sessions instead. The chips can fall where they may -- If he gets behind, that's something our team will have to work out."
"970","This is a long shot, but he may not develop those skills, or if he does it won't go as far as you want.

That's my opinion from being on the opposite end. I've developed in a way where I'm too self-sufficient and independent, so I ask for help too late. I'll carry 10 grocery bags at once and open the door while I'm carrying them, even if someone is there, just for the self-sufficiency challenge. A downside is that I haven't built the types of relationships which other people have.

It might be good to see his behavior as not matching what you need at the moment, but for having advantages down the road. Maybe he'll be better at interpersonal skills in the office. Plus, even if he lacks some critical thinking, he could certainly be expected to remember solutions you've already provided. So if you help him with something once he shouldn't have to ask the same question again. That is a reasonable expectation."
"971","Great perspective here, thank you. Hadn't really considered the flip-side you bring up."
"972","You need to give him open ended help. I'm in a junior position and when I ask my lead dev for help he tells me stuff like ""Try searching for x"", ""You might be able to query for that"" or sometimes more pointed if it's something more difficult like ""Maybe start with looking in the FormBuilder class"".

He will help me more if I go for awhile without making any progress but I'm expected to try to work through problems on my own and I've learned everything I know about the system this way and have become pretty competent over time.

Do not just do things for him. He'll gain nothing from it. If it's time critical walk him through it but make sure he is the one doing it."
"973","Thank you, great to hear this perspective. I think I've let Management's (unrealistic) expectations dictate the pace of his output, which has of course become partly my output. But the only way way to get him to produce at the level they expect is to try and lower that bar for now, so he has time to learn and grow into the role."
"974","Don't tell him what to do. Don't show him what to do.

Tell, and show him, what happens in your brain that allows you to figure out what to do. Setting a break point is easy, most people know how to do that. But how do you know *when* and *where* to set that breakpoint? Everyone knows how to read a log file, but when do you go into the logs versus set a breakpoint? Do you do both? Why? How do you find what you're looking for in a log file? What are you even looking for?

When you see a problem do you instantly know how to fix it? No, something happens in your brain that says ""Hmm... I should place a break point here, here, and here, and see what happens"". What was that thing that happened to get you there? That's what he doesn't know, that's what he needs to be taught.

So next time he needs help, get up, walk over to his computer, and talk to him as you steer his brain towards arriving at the same conclusions you arrived at. Once he knows the pattern of arriving at conclusions, that pattern can be extended to any problem.

A good first question is: ""Ok, what's the problem?""

If he can explain the problem, you can move on. If he can't, now you help him figure out *what* the problem is, and *why* it's a problem.

The next obvious follow up is ""What have you already tried to fix it?""

If he's on the right track, nudge him in that direction. If he's not, you can try to figure out his reasoning for trying those things, maybe he had the right idea but the wrong approach. Guide him down the right path, but you need to make sure he is theone that actually discovers the path."
"975","Wow. This is a truly generalizable solution."
"976","Great advice, thank you. I will definitely be following your model here."
"977","Make sure he writes every session down.
And have him drive the debug. Itll be slow at first but after a few months he should leave you alone."
"978","Had the same thing happen to me at work. A co-worker used to ping me whenever he got stuck. Most of the time, he could have easily found a solution / asked a question on StackOverflow instead of pinging me. After a month or two, the co-worker was fired because the project manager was fed up with the guy's poor performance, missed deadlines, and undelivered promises. I helped as much as I could, but I also took the burden of doing somebody else's work, which eventually reflected on my performance. 

If I were you, I'd be honest with him. Tell him that you're not responsible for doing his work. Of course, it's alright to ask questions and collaborate, but if he pings you with ""Something broke! Help,"" it doesn't sound like he's put any effort into solving the problem and simply hopes to take advantage of you because you've been on the team longer and supposedly know everything about the project. Let him work on his own. Tell him that you're busy and will not be able to help with that. After a few hours, reach out to him and ask how it's going."
"979","Thanks for the perspective. This is where I've started to go -- *I'm in a meeting; I'll take a look in an hour or so if it's still an issue*. That sort of thing. So far though, it's still an issue 100% of the time when I check back in with him.

But then again as others have pointed out, I haven't been helping him help himself. We're in a similar situation to the one you described, constant impending deadlines and shifting requirements. That's life as a developer. And as the senior dev on my team, I'm feeling the weight of responsibility for delivering everything we've been tasked with. But it's also my responsibility to speak up when the expectations from upstairs are unrealistic, especially for a new hire."
"980","&gt;I've probably made this situation worse by doing things for him a couple times

You have to stop helping him so much. You also should communicate to him that the amount of time you spend helping him is starting to hurt your own productivity--he might not even know that this is an issue and just think the fastest way to get an answer is to ping you. Having questions is normal, but it is also something that he can work on limiting.

When he does ask a question, try to do less. It is actually a lot harder than just doing it for him, but coming up with a reasonable hint and then leaving him to figure it out is the only way he will ever improve. 

If your team really runs out of time you can go back and do his work for him later, but don't keep taking on his work until it really comes to that and your manager assigns you that task."
"981","do you feel like he has enough understanding of the code base, relationship models, all the neat extra magic the framework/s may have and how they work? Sometimes that may help him better wield his technical knowledge and problems solving skill,  once he better understands the context"
"982","This is a great point I hadn't considered. I will definitely take some time to walk through the foundation architecture with him some more. I think you may be onto something here."
"983","I hope it helps.

I'm new to a code base and also to the field, and there are 3 things:

1) I have to level up technology-wise - so many libraries, packages, and parts of a framework I haven't used yet. The code base is huge, and some things are done in some complex/savvy ways that make it all work. Almost everything I've been asked to do, I've never done before.  I appreciate that, I can learn, but it isn't easy.  It starts to get easier a bit in general.

2)   The relationships and the particular service being provide is a bit of a web itself, outside of the code itself.  I need to understand better what it is we are actually trying to do, the business. 

3) Sometimes problems and fixes just aren't explained that well.  One task I have, I have verbal instructions, a note in this or that IM, something in a spreadsheet, so on top of points 1 and 2, I have to put that all together.  Tickets need to be organized. Basically, I have to be sure I understand what is actually being asked.  Sometimes that isn't always clear, what exactly am I being asked to build.  Point 2 will also probably help this point 3 as well."
"984","[deleted]"
"985","I'll be applying for my first ones soon. How're you getting on with it in general? How much knowledge did you have before? Are you fitting in well?"
"986","You need to wean him from your help. Ask him what he tried before coming to you. If he says nothing then ask him what do you think you should try? What did you try last time? Etc. Be blunt about ""I need you to try X number of things/x amount of time before you come back to me for more ideas if you're still stuck"".

Be clear you don't want him to spend weeks spinning his wheels on a single problem without help, but at the same time he needs to start developing more independence and troubleshooting skills to start tackling some of these things themselves"
"987","I am not a developer as of yet, I'm still in the learning stages, however, i have been the Technical Support Manager for the past 8 years for my current employer, that being said, there is a right way to troubleshoot and there is a wrong way, everything i do is very granular. I have a process and no matter who i hire in, i always give them this process so they can follow it. After about a month or so, they have made it their own. In the beginning i have to step in because they are new but after a while, it's rare for me to have to take over. Share your process with him, have him go down the list. He doesn't have a process of his own, he's too new. If after his 90 days he or she has not grown technically, I release them but thats usually not the case. I think it's everyone's responsibility to train new hires. Maybe you could ask someone else on your team to help out as well so you can balance the time spent with him."
"988","Sometimes its not critical thinking but a lack of business or architecture knowledge that might let bob piece together the underlying problems they need to target.

It may also be a lack of awareness of certain tools at their disposal especially if said tools may be proprietary. 

We can probably assume that what ever is challenging bobs ability to perform is additionally magnified by his own insecurity (not wanting to blow anything up, not wanting to look stupid, among other things)

I dont want to assume since i know nothing about your team or the work you do, but I would say assessing where his deficiencies are based on your own current knowledge and what someone typically would need to know to understand where to start poking around and why is the first step to addressing the underlying challenges bob is presenting. 

From my own experience I typically find lack of knowledge for the business/product and lack of architecture knowledge to be the common pain points and not the critical thinking part."
"989","A couple people have mentioned this, and I think it's right on. I probably glossed over some of the base architecture stuff, or else it happened so early in Bob's employment that he had no context for it and could gain a lot more from that talk now."
"990","Best of luck m8. I hope it all works out!"
"991","I don't. I hire people with established critical thinking skills because it's way easier :) I establish those critical thinking skills by asking some interview questions. Sometimes I get it wrong, but most of the time I don't. 

&gt; I've tried working through an issue myself with Bob looking on, showing how I use breakpoints, logs, etc. 

We'll generally have to walk our greener engineers through stuff like this that you just don't learn in college.

There's a fine balance between ""beating your head into a wall until it gives"" and ""asking the senior for an hour to avoid wall-head-beating"". Most of the engineers I've worked with are able to find that balance within their respective team. I find I actively have to encourage new people to ask for time from the seniors more often than not, because everyone is ""very important and busy all the time"" in the minds of others. 

&gt; tl;dr - New guy knows how to code but can't solve problems. How do I help him learn how to think critically?

Stop responding. Let the timelines shift. Let the roadmaps get off-track. You're asserting the status quo isn't maintainable, so somethings gotta give. Bob will sink or swim.

And if your management culture doesn't support that, then you need to fire Bob and bring someone else in."
"992","You're looking at this as though op is a manager.  Nowhere in his post did he write that he hired bob."
"993","They're also making it seem as if their hiring strategy is perfect and never slips a problem-solving-deficient candidate through the cracks."
"994","He did say ""Sometimes I get it wrong"", so he is admitting his strategy isn't bulletproof."
"995","You're right; I didn't hire him. I'm just the senior dev on his team. I did, however, participate in the interview process, and I recommended we hire him. Along with everyone else. He interviewed brilliantly, blew it out of the water. But I do think, like /u/healydorf intimated, that our interview process needs some work. There's too much *Can you program* and not enough *Can you think like a programmer*."
"996","Well than this is something you can learn from then. Possibly add a part in the interview process where you give faulty code and they have to figure out what's wrong with it? I'm not sure what the best way to approach this issue is tbh but it's good that you recognized that a mistake happened, which allows you to now go about fixing it."
"997","Tell him to study real analysis"
"998","Sorry to be harsh but:

&gt; New guy knows how to code but can't solve problems.

Solving problems *is what we do*. Code is just the end-product most of the times of us solving problems. If after all the effort you put in he's not picking up at this, it means he does not actually understand what he's doing. If he needs to be spoon-fed everything he's not a developer you want on your team. It means he does not actually understand what he's doing, he's just copy-pasting stuff / following what others do in the hope it works."
"999","I usually just tell them to do things like add some breakpoints and look at what X/Y/Z values are and if they agree what their expectations.  If the ask how do I set breakpoints, they I will say read go read about the tool gdb.

Basically I give them a task with direction within the debugging realm and walk away.  If they don't catch on over  a few months then I talk with our manager and comment how Bob isn't really working out because A/B/C."
"1000","Tell him to read [Seven Tips for a Junior Developer](http://www.pearlleff.com/seven-tips-for-a-junior-developer)."
"1001","Great post, thank you. I will definitely pass this along."
"1002","How can someone have good coding skills but no critical thinking skills? Dont the two go hand in hand"
"1003","You would think so. As others have pointed out though, it may be that what I'm interpreting as a lack of critical thinking is actually just a lack of confidence, a fear of breaking something, or just a lack of knowledge of how the base architecture fits together. The first two are culture/personality fit issues, but the last especially is something I can work on with him on Monday."
"1004","How do you recognize that his coding skills are good? Is his code readable, efficient or just solves the problem?"
"1005","You don't. People who have critical thinking skills but with lesser coding skills will improve fast, but it's hard to acquire critical thinking skills if you don't have any - nevermind how good you might be at coding. Should've considered testing that during the interview."
"1006","Yep, this has come up a few times in this thread. We definitely need to take a look at our interview process. I'm not a manager and don't ultimately make the call of who gets hired or fired, but I can definitely steer my portion of interviews more toward testing critical thinking skills."
"1007","I think if developers are not involved in the hiring process I would start there. Because it really sounds like this guy should've been caught in the process.

I set up an interview process for a client of mine where we basically did a pair-programming session. Happy to explain the process if you're interested."
"1008","i do; you watch

"1009","make bob sit at the computer and type and use the breakpoints. Don't tell him everything. Ask him what he thinks. Tell him he is expected to start figuring this out. You are here to help. Tell him to take notes. Since everything is new he should write stuff down. 

That is fair. If he still does not progress after some time, he won't make it. However, you need to give him time."
"1010","It's a challenge. Critical thinking is reflective of IQ and virtually impossible to change."
"1011","It is not at all clear at this point if he's not troubleshooting his own issues because of behavioral conditioning/bad habits etc, or if he actually doesn't possess the ability for critical thinking. 

Attempt to address the behavior with guidence with coaching and then later assess if it if he has the intellectual horsepower or not"
"1012","[deleted]"
"1013","I don't get why this is being downvoted."
"1014","Because there's a lot of anxious kids here who don't like what you're saying.

Because this is exactly what is going to happen at most companies. If you can't understand what you're doing well enough to be able to debug the stuff you *wrote yourself* you are going to be *fired*. Companies don't pay you to write exactly what others tell you to write, and then let them fix the issues you created."

This sub is dominated by these folks. People who grind leet code. People who make it their life mission to get into Google or Facebook because they feel working elsewhere has no point."
"1018","I can understand why some people chase this, as an F myself.

There is a standard of living afforded by most tech jobs.  And then theres F and G.

Its not unheard of (and very very likely) that by the time youre a principal (L6 at F and G) you can easily be making well over 400k and in some cases way over half a mil TC.  Not to mention literally everything else is covered for you (food, transport, many expenses others have to pay for).

Sure, not everyone is cut out for these jobs and not everyone needs to get a job here to be successful.  But, going from a well known tech company at my last job that already paid damn well to F resulted in an absolutely unbelievably absurd change in my standard of living.  Just my two cents."
"1019","Sure, but quality of life is about a lot more than total compensation from your job. I work at a Big Name and make a lot of money, but as soon as I have free time to get my resume and everything together im leaving asap, and willing to take a pay cut to do it because I kinda hate it. The point of the question and the above response are not whether it can be worth it to grind to get one of these jobs, it's whether it's normal not to do that, which it totally is. As somebody who has done it I'd say it's probably not gonna be the right thing for a lot of people, even if they're totally capable of it, and plenty of people I know who work less and make less money are much more happy with their lives."
"1020","What specifically is disagreeable about a big-name? Culture? The projects? I wish I were in your position right now, being more comfortable in life and knowing how to program. I am in humanities and I am seeking a career change at 31 years old. Its going to require a lot of diligence."
"1021","Mileage will vary quite a lot I'm sure but I personally don't like most tech industry culture to begin with, and the big name I work at (and I'm certain it's not unusual in this regard) has a weird mythology going on. There's a huge difference between liking your job and loving the company you work for as a brand, and that's rampant. As far as projects go, in my case and that of plenty of people I know you work on a team with very specific responsibilities, siloed from other departments and paranoia about sharing too much about what you're working on when you do interact. In my case in particular my superiors are extremely aloof and in a different state, so things are a huge mess and basically I got dropped into leading a team unexpectedly. 

Like i said, mileage will vary on this stuff greatly, probably even within my own company, but I know plenty of developers who might be making a little less money than me but they're still making much more than I'm sure you're coming from--I was a philosophy major who switched over at 28, so I understand--but have more interesting work, with better leadership and cultures, so the main thrust is that it's not necessarily worth grinding specifically to work at one of these companies. It's just a fetish, and the prominence of that fetish is probably a big factor in making it such a weird mess in the first place."
"1022","&gt; principal (L6 at F and G)

Principal at Google is 8. There are probably 1/100 as many L8s as L6s."
"1023","And to add, L5 is a terminal level so you actually have to get yourself promoted above that, it doesn't just happen by virtue of staying long enough."
"1024","You don't get L5 just by staying long enough either. It's just that if you are sitting at L4 for years and years and years people might start looking at why you aren't growing. At L5 there are no longer growth expectations before people get a little concerned."
"1025","L6 can happen with an amortized moderate amount of effort by the time someone turns 45 Id say.

In any case, in the 20s and 30s pre-having a family perse, I can certainly see how some people would slog it out to put themselves at a position of very comfortable wealth later on."

But yeah, planning on making L8 at Google is a recipe for unhappiness. Most engineers never make L6."
"1032","yeah they cant make L6 because they don't have a masters probably. that was my point, at a certain level i don't think you can go any higher without an MS or even a Phd. a quick linkedin search shows there are people who worked there like 15 years and are at fellow level or distinguished engineer or principle and they don't have less than a masters. with most of them having a Phd."
"1033","&gt; yeah they cant make L6 because they don't have a masters probably

This is absolutely 100% completely wrong. I know L6s at Google who don't even have a BS. Education comes up literally not at all in promotion reviews. 

Googlers are disproportionately highly educated. That's what you are seeing here. People who are smart and driven enough to stand out among Google engineers tend to be the sort of people who were smart and driven enough to get lots of degrees.  But loads of L4 engineers have PhDs and have been sitting at L4 for 5+ years. There are plenty of jokes about how many PhDs are just pushing protos at Google. Education background is completely independent of career trajectory.

And yeah I'd expect L8s to have been at Google for a long time. Its enormously difficult to develop the sort of wide influence you need to achieve that level in a short time frame."
"1034","no it isn't lol. jeff dean wouldn't be the head of google brain with just a BA. link me to high level google engineers who only have a BA. I wanna see the linkedin profiles. because I all I can seem to find is Phd and MA"
"1035","You aren't listening to me. Yes, a large portion of L8s have lots of degrees. That's because *a large portion of Googlers have lots of degrees*. I don't see how somebody could think that a masters degree from a decade or more ago has anything to do with advancing to major leadership roles. Feel free to just not believe me I guess.

Listing the specific L7-L8s and directors I've worked with reveals my personal identity too well but you can just look for directors of engineering at Google and find plenty with just bachelors degrees.

"1038","I would have to stand 50/50 on your stance. 

You are right, some people live to get into the big jobs. 

I also agree that not everyone (and honestly, most) enjoy the work and turn it off when they clock out. I completely respect that.

However, some of us grind at work and on our free time because we truly enjoy it. It would drive me nuts to not work on my homelab 3-4 times a week after work.

For example,

I spent my last weekend building an AWX tower for my NAS (for Plex) and server rack so I could automate 99% of it.  

The weekend before that, I spent 12 hours trying to get Zabbix to run in a certain way. Getting it work is the rush of dopamine I really enjoy. 

For a few of us, it's not the job, money, or title. It's just our passion."
"1039","&gt; It would drive me nuts to not work on my homelab 3-4 times a week after work.

That is very different from what the OP was referring to I feel. I too have a homelab, and I would go insane if I didn't get to dabble with personal projects. But, OP is going for, I think, people who's ""hobby"" is grinding away on leetcode. I am very confident that the people who dabble in homelabs doing it pretty much solely for working a better job compared to doing it for fun, is much less than the people on leet code doing the same."
"1040","Oh, I see what you mean. That's fair. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, agreed."
"1041","Side projects are always fun and are an easy resume ticket item. Leetcode questions are just about acing the technical interview, which is 5% of the real interview. The majority of the interview is about seeing if you can fit into the company's culture."
"1042","90% of my interviews are coding questions"
"1043","I think you are giving way too much credit to this sub!"
"1044","I don't think that grinding leetcode is necessarily true for everyone because for some it might true but for other its a hobby. I started coding not because I want to get a job in some big name companies but I just enjoy coding, leet code and other competitive programming websites are just places where I can practice and improve my problem solving skills. If someone doesn't enjoy problem solving I don't think they should work as a software engineer or any types of technical job. I don't know much about what they do in industry so I might also be wrong about my assumptions."
"1045","I think youre getting downvoted because you imply that not wanting to do challenges like Leetcode equates to not enjoying problem solving. When working as a professional software engineer, chances are you solve problems all day long that often have a real weight to them, at least for your career or your company. It can be rather hard to want to code more after already coding 50 hours a week, and especially so if its something isolated and random like a problem assigned by a website. Personally, I would never do Leetcode etc for fun, but I have worked on a passion project."
"1046","downvoting doesn't really mean much to me because I knew I was going to get downvote anyway. Doing something fun is subjective but you might be right about not wanted to do anything with after having to code for 50 hours a week. Also I don't think they just code all the time especially when you collaborate with other team members and designed your solution before implementing it."
"1047","&gt; Also I don't think they just code all the time especially when you collaborate with other team members and designed your solution before implementing it.

That's the most important part of coding. This is the difference in thinking between a senior engineer with years of experience and someone who hasn't entered the industry yet but grinds problem sets."
"1048","Yes, of course we dont write code all day long, but were still thinking about it! Sometimes I have so many other things going on at work that when I do get the chance to just program its a joy. But that doesnt mean I want to put my mind back into that mental space when I leave work most of the time, even if most of the day has been eaten up writing a design doc or discussing customer needs with project managers or whatever."
"1049","Well stated. I am on Job #4, almost 10 years into the industry. That's about a 2 year tenure average. I only ever ""leetcoded"" for about 4 weeks total in the past decade, closer to the start of my career than recently, but still not like 300+ problems a month or anything like that. That's completely unecessary, rote memory will help you memorize those keyboard shortcuts a bit better, but that's about it. If I worried the way this sub does then I would have been dead by age 30. Everyone's gotta chill out! We're all in this life thing together."
"1050","Username checks out"
"1051","This is really good advice"
"1052","Ive been going on 2 years minus my first 30 days looking for another offer. Seems like some jobs are so bad the mere presence of them on ones resume precludes them from escaping."
"1053","NOT TRUE MUST DO LEETCODE NOW GOOGLE CEO JUST OFFERED ME TO BE HIS POOL BOY FOR 300K TC"
"1054","Living life IS the goal. But, you DO need money to do that comfortably, particularly as you progress in life. Mortage, wife, kids, health care, savings, retirement/401k, getting a high salary earlier will make the later years of your life easier with the magic of compound interest.

Leetcode hell is real, unless you're in non-tech hubs, or working in non-tech products (where you'll get nearly half TC of a tech product, I know because I get this in an expensive tech hub). 

There's definitely a balance to it all, but the sub is pretty accurate in terms of finding work in target cities/companies, you're not going to skate around technical round interviews where the goal is literally to fail you unless you can do DS&amp;A."
"1055","Sturgeon's law applies as usual."
"1056","How do I buy gold? Although really ive been at this for years and haven't gotten to that entry level job yet :/"
"1057","Thanks so much, I need this right now."
"1058","Honestly after you have some years of experience and a couple side projects to show. You won't have to grind leetcode. 

This sub has gotten to the point that its FAANG/Big N or bust."
"1059","But grinding LeetCode, that should be done daily, regardless of who you are, or what you want."
"1060","/s"
"1061","This sub though you were serious, hilarious"
"1062","You think there arent people around here who say the same thing unironically, unamusing"
"1063","I think 90% of this sub doesn't know their arse from their elbow and are so engrossed in believing everything they read that they'd take obvious sarcasm and think the person was serious."
"1064","They dont know their elbow from their ass, so they come here looking for real answers, and somehow thats their fault? Thats not how that works...."

"1066","hehe dude my thought exactly? OP was specifically referring to the 'pressure' from this subreddit? Exactly my thought my vibe is most popular posts are from teenagers or early 20s. There is no pressure from this community man. there are plenty of posters who dont give a shit about grinding l33tcode or making big bucks working at a sleezy ad agency whose sole purpose is to collect all our data and sell it.

"1074","It only feels like 1.2 billion."
"1075","&gt;Why are you allowing a bunch of FAANG-obsessed Internet randos...

Once upon a time, the brightest minds launched startups. They had radical ideas and wanted to explore their potential. It takes guts striking out on your own with nothing to validate yourself but the confidence in your very own idea.

Maybe it's navigating healthcare in America, maybe it's that housing prices have skyrocketed with respect to inflation and wage growth. Whatever the reason is - people are afraid to strike out on their own and want some universally accepted indicator of success; getting into a FAANG seems to scratch that itch.

Personally, I want to end up at a startup - the sorta place where I can get hundreds of stock options, knowing if the company makes it, so do I. But this mentality isn't widely shared on this sub."
"1076","Im still in the job search but man was I close to an opportunity like this, in the end the startup decided to go with the other guy. Amazing product, great vision and the CEO already had a prior successful exit."
"1077","While I agree with your sentiments, do you actually think 30 years ago people were more entrepreneurial? People still wanted to work at the big companies at the time, from IBM to GE to banking to consulting or whatever. Startups were more unknown in 1990s than now. The only difference is that the general public now knows more about lucrative tech jobs so people who previously went to banking for the money are now attracted to FAANG."
"1078","You're kidding, right?  The history of the 1990s, 1980s and 1970s is _littered_ with startups."
"1079","I didn't say there were no startups, I said they were more unknown in 1990 than now."
"1080","&gt; Personally, I want to end up at a startup - the sorta place where I can get hundreds of stock options, knowing if the company makes it, so do I.

The problem here is that compensation at the major tech companies has grown so much that it is *unbelievably* difficult to match it even if your startup makes it. Exiting at 100M with 0.5% ownership is 500k. You'd make up that difference in a few years working at a major company. 

If you want ""if we make it I will end up with more money"" to work you need to be a founder."
"1081","&gt;I never opened Leetcode in my browser, never went to a meetup and I only code at work

Been doing this for about 8 years. I've also never done leet code, went to a meetup or code outside work.

It's called having a life. I'm married, have a newborn, house to take care of, gym five times a week and play sports three times a week. On top of all that, see friends a couple times a month and bust out the PS4..

Don't be scared of what you see here. It's mostly fresh grads that aspire to work at these massively popular companies and want $400k a year. If only they all realized at a young age, to make enough money to pay the bills and save a bit, and then make a life for themselves outside of work."

"1100","Thanks for the recommendation, Ill check it out!"
"1101","Oh wow, this is great, thank you!"
"1102","Just FYI, I ran some stats on experienceddevs, and while it appears at one point the forum was not too saturated with youngins, it's increasingly becoming dominated by CSCQ posters.

See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/eu3wt8/how_many_senior_developers_are_there_that_give/fflj6qo?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) and my related response to my post, which indicates that about 40% of commentators in EXPDEV are also CSCQ commentators.  Across all viewable reddit time (posts up to 1000) the stats are better, but more recent ones are seeing an influx of CSCQ posters."
"1103","While interesting, I'll argue that the reason for your stats are that most people learn about that sub from a reference in this sub."
"1104","That's the most likely cause, but the cause doesn't mitigate the effect.  40% of comments are from CSCQ commentators.  There's a case to be made that, in fact, this is a \*bad\* thing.    


What is the best case scenario here for people seeking advice?  The best case is that 40% of people in EXPDEV who have solid advice are also commenting in this sub forum.  The worst case is that 40% of people in EXPDEV are \*exactly\* the kind of people you don't want commenting in EXPDEV (inexperienced people).  


If people are going to EXPDEV because people are diverting CSCQ user attention to that forum, then that means EXPDEV is picking up lots of inexperienced people who are now giving advice there.  


The ideal scenario, if you're hoping to find quality advice here and in EXPDEV, would be people are directing EXPDEV users here, but instead the opposite is happening.  


There is a scenario I haven't cleaned the data up on, which would really clarify the issue if someone wants to do it, which is to not include users if they \*only\* made comments within their own posts to EXPDEV.  This way you could really understand whose giving advice."

"1109","One possible way to measure that is to chart the subscriber growth of this sub and that sub and see if theyre proportional."
"1110","Like the other poster said, I dont think that means much since most people are directed there from here.   Its a much harder analysis to make but it probably makes more sense to evaluate how posters evaluate their experience on the sub over time and if it goes up or down."
"1111","See my reply to that poster, I think the fact that we're funneling people over there is actually an important thing, not a less meaningful one.  It means it is quite possible this subreddit is lowering the quality of that reddit by constantly funneling people there.  


That \*may\* not be happening, but it's something to be wary of."
"1112","Right.  All Im saying is that before any sort of effect from a relationship can be hypothesized and investigated, the relationship first needs to be proven.  The relationship might even be positive since it keeps people discussing things that are more relevant to them.  Or it might be negative, I know we occasionally see accounts here saying theyre a college freshmen while also posting there that they have 10 years experience."
"1113","Ughhh no.  Dont tell people about that sub. It will be like the Eternal September. The fewer people who know about it the better."

"1115","Thank god. I've been looking for something like this."
"1116","Yea this sub is total trash"
"1117","FAANG doesnt automatically equal having no life. Sure you have to put in some hours to study and pass the interviews but once you are on the other side, its a pretty cushy life and great work life balance. Its an investment, not a death sentence to your work life balance.

That being said, despite what this sub seems to think, there are plenty of other good companies that pay well and have normal interviews, but of course those people dont really post online about it. They just get a job and live happily ever after."
"1118","Is the stuff mentioned by OP (going to meetups, grinding Leetcode, studying/coding outside of work) needed on the regular, for a dev to get into FAANG? I was under the impression that you just needed a decent amount of work experience, and a month or two of interview prep."
"1119","Going to meetups, coding outside of work is sort of a substitute for work experience. If you already have work experience, then yes just some leetcode prep would be plenty for FAANG."
"1120","I got into FAANG without going to meetups, and did about an hour of prep each day for a month (with 0 prior algorithm experience). I had prior work experience already.

I have a solid 10-6 WLB and WFH 1-2 days a week.

Not sure thats what people want to hear in this sub though."
"1121","That's dope, congrats. 
Just curious, what do you think of your experience with FAANG? I feel like a lot of people try to get to it because they don't really think about it and have that as their only goal. Do you think it should be as coveted as it is?"
"1122","I recently accepted a FAANG position for after I graduate.  My experience was that I was fine without having dedicated years to leetcode like I see people talk about here.  I have about 4 semesters of part-time dev work experience, a summer as a CS teaching assistant, a summer of CS research, and a few largely unrelated jobs on my resume.  I spent about two weeks total doing leetcode and reading over old algorithms class notes during class and for maybe an hour or two after I got home."
"1123","[deleted]"
"1124"," &gt;But in reality, most people are gonna need months-years assuming you aren't leetcoding 5 hours a day.

If you mean ""most"" as in ""most people that are grabbed randomly off the street"", then probably yes, as is intended.

If you mean ""most"" as in ""most people who are qualified to work at a FAANG and just need to improve on this one thing"", then I highly, highly doubt that. 

The questions aren't all that difficult (just went through multiple FAANG interviews last year), they mainly want you to show your thought process, plus a whole bunch were questions adapted from their work problems anyways, not from leetcode, so the grinding won't save you there. Not to mention at my level, the real killer is the system design interview. I fail far more people in this design round than in any other (I do 4-5 of these a week in my current role).

People who grind leetcode tend to miss the point of the interview and just go for raw memorization, and just hope they get something they knew from before, so no wonder they fail so much. People who are qualified for FAANG tend to already have pretty decent problem solving techniques and communication, so as long as they spend a few weeks brushing up on the basics, gain from any further prep is largely marginal.

And to reemphasize, if you're not entry level, and spend all your time leetcode grinding, you're gonna get destroyed by system design. Almost guaranteed. If you're gonna grind anything, grind that one."
"1125","[deleted]"
"1126","&gt; But leaving that aside, I feel the fact of the matter is, even if you have the proper thought process and communicate it accurately, the reality is, there could be other candidates that managed to do that and also get the question completely solved, which gives them an edge.

Obviously, you have to get the question right, my point is that if you have the proper thought process, then you basically don't need to grind for months/years, it's almost pointless given how marginal the benefits are. And the people who do grind, probably haven't mastered the thought process.

&gt; Is the final push that gets them the offer rather trivial? Yes, I'd say so, but it exists nonetheless, and serves the purpose of cutting down from many candidates to the amount of open positions. And again, something like this can only be answered by all of the companies releasing their interview evaluation process, leaving out our guesswork.

What push? I feel like you need to understand the interview process for FAANG before making ambiguous claims like this. The majority of positions aren't for individual teams, they're company wide, or at least org wide. You're not being compared against someone else directly, you're being compared against a bar (or a couple of bars), and as long as you pass that bar, you're a hirable candidate. Google and Facebook don't even assign you to a team until after the committee approves you. 

That bar isn't dependent upon how quickly you solved the leetcode. It's dependent on everything from your interview panel, of which the ""optimality"" of the solution to the algo question is but one thing. If you waste months/years just to get a mere 5% better at that one thing, it's only going to result in a trivial change in your overall panel results, if any.

* the caveat is that performance in the interview can be used to gauge your level, but that's mostly in system design and communication, not the algo panels. 

* and if you solve the leetcode too quickly, without properly explaining it, they'll assume you just remembered the solution and reject you anyways.

&gt; And again, would it be possible for the average cs grad from an average school to ace these interviews? Definitely, but the probability of that occurring is not in that students favour.

The point of these interviews is to weed out ""the average cs grad from an average school"". Because the average CS grad from the average school isn't qualified for FAANG. That's why I specified what ""most"" means. The point I'm making is that for the target demographic these interviews are designed for, there is no need to grind for years. If you're not qualified and want to become qualified, then yes, you have to prepare, but the preparation you need is holistic, not just leetcode grinding."
"1127","Absolutely not"
"1128","Nah, we out here G. We out here."
"1129","I think OP's sentiment was that getting a job at a place like Google isn't some incredible life achievement anymore (or at least this sub doesn't represent it as such)... Instead, getting in at Google is the new ""meeting expectations,"" which makes everything else come across a settling, if not outright failure. At least that's how I've come to understand the r/cscareerquestions metaculture. 

Getting a job at IBM, Intel, Oracle, etc. should be something to brag about. But on this sub the atmosphere is \~""why didn't you grind out a few more LCs? You could've been at Google instead of settling for IBM"""
"1130","&gt; the atmosphere is \~""why didn't you grind out a few more LCs?  

I think this type judgement is self inflicted. I've been on this sub for a while and haven't seen anyone actively shaming someone for not going for FAANG. If nobody is responding to your post or comment, it's probably because there is generally less knowledge about that company and how it operates, and not because people are judging you for not achieving or trying to achieve FAANG."
"1131","&gt; I think this type judgement is self inflicted. I've been on this sub for a while and haven't seen anyone actively shaming someone for not going for FAANG.

A-fucking-men to this and your longer comment above. People are tilting at windmills here about being criticize for their choice to not aspire to FAANG.

I have zero issues if you don't want to get into a FAANG. And I've never seen anybody else here having an issue with it either. I always ask for examples... and I never get any.

I have massive issue if you act like I don't have a life because I chose to spend a few weeks preparing for an interview that would massively boost the quality of the remaining decades of my life."
"1132","I mean perhaps people just dont want to invest the time and effort into searching the reddit history for examples of comments where people have shamed others for not going to faang. It would be a massive waste of time, afterall."
"1133","The fact that you'd have to hunt to find these comments just goes to show how rare they actually are.

Well, if you got a job at Oracle OCI, than you're TC is almost certainly 180K+. Oracle OCI is trying to poach Amazon talent by being slightly better than Amazon in every way (comp, benefits, WLB). That should qualify Oracle devs to feel like they are FAANG developers (most of them are)

I also work at one of these ""massively popular companies"" you're referring to (and earn pretty close to $400k).

Your two comments taken together seem to imply that ""having a life"" and ""working at one of these massively popular companies"" are two things that can't coexist. They most certainly can.

Most developers will never see 400k /yr in their entire life, even if they work double the hours as a senior developer at a reputable company in a high cost of living area.

Also, many people could spend 5+ years banging their head against LeetCode and still not be able to pass the medium/hards. The point I think the TC was getting at is that this sub often makes it sound like if you don't live and breathe CS, spending every waking moment of your life for potentially years mastering DS &amp; A and grinding gimmicky problems at LeetCode, you will not have a place in this industry or you'll simply be a code monkey earning $30k a year adjusting the fonts on web pages. What they probably actually mean is you probably won't have a place at a Big N, but since this is r/cscareerquestions and not r/bigNquestions people coming here for an overall look at the profession as a whole tend to get discouraged.

Let's be honest, there's not one person here who wouldn't like to work at a Big N. Who wouldn't want more prestige, more money, better benefits, etc. But not everyone can or is willing to put that level of effort into it."
"1152","alternate data point:

- did many MOOCs
- went to many meetups
- did some euler, hackerrank

got no job

Truth lies elsewhere"
"1153","Agreed. I work for a company most people have never heard of and I get paid very well, have fantastic quality of life, and like the people I work with. Looking at this sub made me wonder if I was living in an alternate reality. My experience has been that if you're capable and a decent person, that will get you just as far (if not further) than grinding algo problems (though I do like to do hackerrank problems for fun / because I like working with different algorithms and love computer science).

Alot of the people in this sub honestly remind me of the loudest and least capable kids from school, who fundamentally lack self awareness, and (in my mind) see comp sci as a means to an end rather than a beautiful, developing body of knowledge."
"1154","but, that's just not the field anymore is it? It may have been true 20 years ago that the majority of software engineers and computer scientists saw the field as a ""beautiful, developing body of knowledge"". But with all the money that's coming in, that's not the case anymore...and that's fine? I mean, no one goes after accountants and lawyers accusing them of being self-serving mercenaries, instead of pursuing some greater truth. People have to eat."
"1155","There is almost no job in this field won't immediately have you making more than the median for an entire households by yourself, if not multiple times that. The focus on FAANG in this sub is ridiculous because of that. Oh no, you're making slightly more than the median for the average household in the US just out of school. Poor you. 

I'm not saying money isn't important, but in most other fields, the pay is shit and then gets good. Even doctors who are the go to for money have shit pay in the beginning if you count the unpaid years long internship that is residency and then again if you consider the insane student loan burden they all have to carry. 

Not working at Google or whatever shouldn't be seen as the failure people make it out to be on this sub. That's just insanity for a career where no matter who you are, you are going to break 6 figures within the first decade and that's if you're very slow about it."
"1156","i agree with what you're saying, but i'm not sure why this is a reply to me...or how it's relevant to the point i'm making.

i only wanted to address the previous poster's assertion that we should expect new people to the industry to prioritize some beautiful platonic telos of the pursuit of knowledge over work as a ""means to an end""....i.e. as a means to, you know, live and do other things with life that aren't compsci.

very strange mentality to me."
"1157","That's fair, but you can't have it both ways then. There can't be this superior being FAANG hivemind mentality when really people are just chasing doe. Reminds me of people lining up for hours to get the new iPhone who's greatest new feature is there's no more headphone jack. Also, comp sci is the youngest distinct science we have. 20 years ain't shit. I think it's pretty cool that we get to be a part of shaping the conventions and direction of it, even though everyone doesn't need to feel that way."
"1158","Not to mention that, I think, a genuine passion for the subject as opposed to a strictly utilitarian approach, tends to lead to a better understanding. Also, this sub is called 'cscareerquestions', not 'devcareerquestions'."
"1159","HAHAHHA NOT BIG N DEV?! HAHAHHAHA"
"1160","I'm having a great time in my Hackspace tho. People here are chill as fuck. Nobody needs this, but I enjoy hanging out w people who understand that sitting around with your pc in silence is totally acceptable as a social experience."
"1161","or make way more and work less years in life with a massive saving?"
"1162","This entirely depends on region. Im im NYC and I cannot get a high quality job without practicing Leetcode for interviews"
"1163","So I'm not messing up by wanting to take time with learning how to be a 1337 hackerman and devoting half of my other time trying to find a place to live and build a life for myself?"
"1164","Some of us failed at both career and life tyvm"
"1165","They also dont realize theyre going to be forced to work 100 hours a week for that 120k starting salary.. and enjoy paying 4000 a month for a 1 bedroom lol"
"1166","Ironically, the most popular posts as of late in this sub are like this one. I see a new ""this sub sucks"" on my home feed every day."
"1167","this has been the case for quite a while, lol. the other commonality: they always wildly exaggerate how much time a (sane) person spends on leetcode. It always sounds like if you do leetcode, you're basically in some sort of Algorithm Prison where you spend all your waking hours digging trenches to trap rain water"
"1168","/r/cscqUnpopularOpinions"
"1169","Which doesn't make sense considering most people on this sub suggest NOT stressing over FAANG and leetcode"
"1170","At this point it's just posts seeking self validation.

You're fine if you don't leetcode or want to go faang. You don't have to knock others who do."
"1171","Exactly this. And the people that push the whole ""big companies in SF/Seattle aren't worth it because of high CoL"" narrative to cover their own insecurities. Thanks to them you have 22 year old new grads asking if they should turn down a job in SF to stay in Texas because of CoL. They are just as bad if not worse than the fang or nothing people."
"1172","maybe because the others outnumber those 15:1, and when this kind comes a lot of the ""silent majority"" feels it's time to jump in and write they agree"
"1173","You have the most blind-esque flair I've ever seen lol"
"1174","Honestly dont understand why mods dont delete low effort posts like this."
"1175","[deleted]"
"1176","Nope. Don't worry about it.

I've been a Senior SWE for many years and not even opened leetcode in my life. Sure if you wanna work at FAANG you'll probably need to do it at some point. But there are hundreds of thousands, probably even millions of good, well paying engineering jobs that won't test you on shit like that during the interviews.

You'll learn how to build algorithms and solve problems at work, you don't need to grind that shit to get jobs once you have experience. Despite what this sub makes you believe."
"1177","Ive worked at two FAANG companies and Ive never done leetcode. Ive hired many people too, and leetcode doesnt factor into my approach. 

To the OP: Stay curious, keep learning, find gaps in your org where you can become an expert. Over the long term, this generates a lot of value."
"1178","You could be lying."
"1179","You basically do have to grind it at least a little to get work straight out of school though."
"1180","I didn't, graduated on the east coast, put out a half dozen crappy resumes and got job offers for all of them.

Pretty much everyone I've talked to around here and graduated with has the same story, if people want real advice they really need to get specific as to the actual city they live in and are applying to because it must matter a ton..."
"1181","I didn't when I left university. I'm in the UK though, there appears to be a lot less SWEs here than in the US. I applied for about 10 roles to get my first junior role, if that. Had two offers in the end. It's totally different here."
"1182","You absolutely do not. You don't ever have to touch it or worry about it at all.

Everyone I knew during my CS degree had internships through-out , and before graduating we all had several job offers from companies.

I can't speak for all of the students, but me and my friends never did any leet code, in fact out of all the interviews I did for internships / graduation , I only had 1 company that asked any technical question at all. The rest were super chill and understood that if I made it through the CS degree, I could learn the job pretty damn easily, so it was mainly behavioral stuff.

This sub is so far removed from reality it's ridiculous."
"1183","Your experience is highly unique then. Im a MS student and Im graduating in June, with no internships and a few personal projects. Ive applied to almost 170 companies since January. Only got around 20 positive responses and, yes, every one of them was leetcode online assessments. Most of them were leetcode medium questions, which I couldnt answer because Im really shit at leetcode-style questions. Most of my friends havent found jobs and the only one who have were the ones who have were the ones who grinded leetcode last year. And no, Im not only applying to FAANG companies either. I wish I could find these companies all of you people are working at because I need a job and I hate doing leetcode"
"1184","Could just be that your resume isn't great? My understanding is that when someone looks at a resume, they're looking at it 10s at most. So for me I keep contact info, work history and a bunch of projects on the front, and then education and lists of programming languages and frameworks on the back.

Personally though I've met a fair amount of people with BS/MS degrees who don't know anything practical and people with no degree with basically doctorate-level knowledge so I guess there's something to be said about how much people actually understand their degree vs regurgitating their degree."
"1185","Ive had my resume worked on a lot, but yeah thats probably one reason. Unfortunately without internships theres not much you can do to make it look better."
"1186","I'd recommend heavily getting involved into an open source project, or more. That was vital to me getting my first job."
"1187","Did you avoid applying to larger companies? I haven't exactly been picky with where I have been applying. But the vast majority of companies I've interviewed with for internships have asked some form of technical question. 

Were you never asked to go in depth with any of your projects or past work experience? All of your interviews were purely behavioral?"
"1188","So basically ""my experience is better than yours""? =M"
"1189","My job had me write code to reverse a string for my interview. Now they have people do fizz buzz. They only care that you didnt lie about being able to code.

If youre a CS grad you probably dont need to grind any leetcode to do either of those problems."
"1190","""My job had me ________"" != The rest of the industry

Random companies in wisconsin are filtering out new grads with leetcode easy and mediums"
"1191","You definitely dont. Maybe a bit of a hot take but Id argue if youre a pretty good student you can pass some faang interviews with no leetcode."
"1192","This is what I want. I want a good work life balance. Time for my family. And decent pay. Hope it works out that way"
"1193","It's crazy that it's the norm for programmers to expect to code in their free time.

I got a 6 month kid, I got like 1-2 hours max of free time over in a day. Not like I will spend my only free time coding.

I try to do some pluralsight courses when I got time over at work. I see it as part of our routine as developers to keep learning.

But damnit that is on company time."
"1194","&gt;it's the norm for programmers to expect to code in their free time.

I don't think it's the norm, but I think the reason that many programmers also code in their free time is because many of us enjoy coding and creating things to make our lives easier. It's like mechanics who go home and work on their customized truck"
"1195","My logic is if I can't get paid to learn on company time, the place I work at sucks."
"1196","can we as a sub:

1. respect the ambitious who want to work hard to better their and their family's lives and

2. respect those who want to separate themselves from the grind and just work their 9-5s?

I don't understand why everyone on one side needs to shit on everyone on the other side. Both paths are perfectly reasonable.

But to respond to OP: I think grinding in the short term (couple of weeks to months) to ensure a better work experience (where we spend 8+ hours a day) and more pay (a lot of us come from tenuous financial situations or just like $ lol) is perfectly reasonable. I'm certainly happy I did so."
"1197","Its ridiculous lmao. Obviously people that want to talk about coding as a career in their free time will be more into their career than the average rando. Its just selection bias."
"1198","Exactly, in my free time instead of posting here I... well, I code, but fun stuff, my own enjoyable yet ultimately useless quixotic projects, not leetcode. I learn, but I'm motivated because I want to have more fun."
"1199","well said. thats one thing i never understood about this sub. both paths are completely valid and understandable, but people here have some sort of need to validate their own path by undermining others"
"1200","This is what i find so weird about this post. It's like patronizing a person who is trying to build a really fit body and not just satisfied with an average one. Some peoples lives revolve around their work rather than having babies and there is nothing wrong with it."
"1201","Highly disagree. The more accurate comparison is that there are people who think their life revolves around getting and staying fit and then becoming as fit as humanly possible.

The FAANG obsessed are the minority around who say you need to be grinding leetcode constantly and that they wont be happy until theyre making well beyond their means trying to retire at 30. Its honestly incredibly unhealthy and entirely unnecessary. You can satisfy both the above 2 criteria for the original commenters ability to respect others, but that minority has an unhealthy obsession with the dollar."
"1202","Although I don't agree with your opinion, I agree with why you're saying it: this sub combines the casual and hardcore crowds into one place, even though they have drastically different mindsets. It reminds me of /r/fitness and /r/bodybuilding. Maybe we should have a casual and hardcore version of CSCQ?"
"1203","&gt;The FAANG obsessed are the minority around who say you need to be grinding leetcode constantly and that they wont be happy until theyre making well beyond their means trying to retire at 30.

I've been here for years. I've never seen one of these posts.

What I have seen is several posts every week railing against these imaginary people, telling everyone that FAANG is actually bad, pushing BS about the cost of living canceling out FAANG compensation, and trashing everyone with the ambition to try to work there rather than take a job in Kansas."
"1204","Rather than take a job in Kansas. You seem to be one of them, implying if you dont have the ambitions to work in such a renowned area as the Bay area that youll be in fucking no where Kansas. Is that your argument and what youre implying? Because it seems to prove the argument I and others make."
"1205","I have no plans to take a job in Silicon Valley. I'm from a red state that most people would not consider a total backwater, and I plan to stay here for most of my career if so long as it is an option.

&gt;Is that your argument and what youre implying? Because it seems to prove the argument I and others make.

Let me reiterate since you did not read my comment:

&gt;&gt;The FAANG obsessed are the minority around who say you need to be grinding leetcode constantly and that they wont be happy until theyre making well beyond their means trying to retire at 30.

&gt;I've been here for years. I've never seen one of these posts.

My central point was that the vast majority of the circlejerking about FAANG on this sub is the people trashing FAANG, not the FAANGers or FAANG-wannabes preaching FAANG-or-bust. The post I see regarding FAANG are either FAANG-bashing or people simply asking what they should do to get in.

Your post was very hostile when to me, yet I was not hostile to you. I find that your post strongly validates the point that I've made. Thank you for doing a better job of arguing my point than I did."
"1206","Says the person who refers to non Silicon Valley as kentucky. Sure, sure did prove your point for ya though!"
"1207","Then in a blink of an eye you're old and frail and realize you literally wasted away your life making some other guy rich.

Wake up. There is more to life than work. You NEED a balance."
"1208","why is this myth constantly being perpetuated in this sub. earning a lot of money does not equate to working long hours. you can have your cake and eat it too"
"1209","Because 1.) they heard a rumor about it on this sub and 2.) they failed to get into FAANG so its their way of saying I wouldnt want to work there anyways."
"1210","Counterpoint: You can grind early and reap the rewards of your investment for the rest of your life. Your advise is like telling 18 year olds not to become doctors because they have to grind too hard for the next 10 years. You can work hard early in your career and still manage great relationships, health, and hobbies. And then you can ease into a comfortable work-life balance for the rest of your life and reap the return on the investment you made. 

I worked hard in my 20s and live a very balanced life in my early 30s, I'll be retired before I'm 40. And I sacrificed nothing important to do it; I guess I watched a little less TV and drank a bit less than my peers."
"1211","But this is a bit the point he refers to imo, that implying you are better of working hard in 20s to retire ""early"" whatever that means, and this is something to strive for. Why can't people just enjoy what they do without ""buuut what if you did X for some years! hah!""

For example me, I LIKE to work in software companies and learn and do real world stuff. I am NOT looking to retire early even if I could, but yet a lot of people need to tell that all the time how good it is"
"1212","True. I guess I felt like the choice presented was either have a life or focus on career advancement. There's definitely a way to do both. Maybe that was their point too."
"1213","This is what I don't get as well. Imagine patronizing everyone that works hard and has ambition. If everyone followed their advice, their would be no doctors, businessmen, scientists, etc."
"1214","How? Its a win win relationship, Im happy with my 250k TC too.

People always assume high TC = No WLB. IT DOESNT. You only need to grind 2-3 months for searching jobs"
"1215","This comment is the problem. Just grind 2-3 months. Not even remotely true for everyone. Some people simply struggle with leetcode, even after grinding for a while. And thats fine. But backhanded comments shoving your total compensation around like you are is exactly the kind of negative attitude OP speaks about.

You can be proud of your life without arrogance."
"1216","Then don't do it? THERE ARE TONS OF COMPANIES OUT THERE DON'T ASK LEETCODE. I do Leetcode because I want my 200k TC, that's all. 

Remember noone force you to do Leetcode, if you are happy with your salary and don't want to do it, it's totally fine."
"1217","You can care about that and not shove dollar amounts in everyones face which is the point. Its a pretty backhanded comment. Feel free to live your life and Ill make $200K TC. We get it, you make more than most people. The way you keep bringing it into every comment is the point youre missing."
"1218","I bring it up because I want to show my point on Leetcode, if it makes you feel uncomfortable then Im sorry."
"1219","It doesnt its just out of place. People are well aware via levels and other sights how much FAANG makes (200-300K). Pushing YOUR salary as your defense is the difference. But its all good"
"1220","[deleted]"
"1221","Im sure you have the wrong idea about Leetcode, if you memorize, you are doing it wrong. I never memorize anything, I do enough to know the pattern. 

And again, nobody force you to do Leetcode. THERE ARE TONS OF COMPANIES OUT THERE DON'T ASK LEETCODE. If you are happy with your salary, it's fine, do you way.

But If you want more than 200k, you do Leetcode, it's simple."
"1222","It's not a one way street, it's fairly naive to think that just because you make more money means you have to work more."
"1223","Then in a blink of an eye you're old and frail and realize you wasted away your life trying to barely provide for your kids with a 60K salary which was not even enough for their college tuition and left you with an abysmal retirement corpus. Or instead you could have grinded leetcode/cs for a year to change your as well as your children's lives."
"1224","Not even true in this industry. Most jobs in this field are life changing for a family. Jfc"
"1225","[deleted]"
"1226","Nothing wrong with that at all. Most people need to live a little and leave more to their life than their career."
"1227","Or you can fat* FIRE your 200k income working 10 hour days making your bosses wealthy and retire in your early 50's with well over 10 million in savings and do whatever you want after that. Who cares, there are plenty of roads to Rome, dude."
"1228","that's not lean FIRE lol."
"1229","Youre right, 10 mill retirement definitely wouldnt be lean. What I meant to say is that you just have to save almost all of your income to that point, but thats still Fat FIRE."
"1230","Just when I want to enjoy free time. When I hit my 50's!"
"1231","50s is still fairly young, especially if you lead a healthy lifestyle. Not like most FAANG SWEs hate their jobs that much until that point anyway."
"1232","So.. You want folks to retaliate to ""the wealthy man"" by making themselves objectively poorer? Seems legit. Fuck the system, eh?"
"1233","Then pick better work and make yourself rich. Build a business and begin to provide for others families in addition to your own. 

Everyone's needed balance is different."
"1234","To use the metaphor, it sounds like he takes issue with spending 3 or 4 hours at the gym every day, being disappointed with the results and then obsessing over a certain level of fitness.  At a certain point, it's not healthy."
"1235","[deleted]"
"1236","Idk why you got downvote, what you said has some merit. This field has poor retention rate amongst certain groups people. If this industry focused on treating employees with some real concern, things would be better."
"1237","People shit on the other group because, deep down, they're very insecure. Abd shitting all over the other group helps them with that. That is sadly how humans work."
"1238","&gt; I don't understand why everyone on one side needs to shit on everyone on the other side.

No one is 'shitting' on anyone really. We have these posts at least once a week and they all follow the same pattern. They're just meant to pull on your heart strings to get attention/karma, nothing more."
"1239","Once a week is an understatement!"
"1240","Well said. Reddit reflects a small portion of the industry and those that post represent an even smaller portion of the community. Usually those most willing to speak up will have stronger opinions in either extreme. As a community, the onus is on us to keep checks-and-balance amongst *all* perspectives. As individuals, well, hopefully we have the resolve to filter out what should or shouldn't be relevant; Catch-22 I suppose."
"1241","thank you for acknowledging there's two sides. some people enjoy coding and such. others don't. Both are fine.


There's no shame in wanting to just work a 9-5 and have a lot of free time. There's no shame in wanting to grind and try to get a high paying job straight out of college. 


Some people want to spend their free time coding and others see it as work because they also code at work and maybe I'm wrong, but you can do work activities in your free time for fun. And there's nothing wrong with that."
"1242","I would add about programmers from third world countries. For most of them landing a job at Big N means literally 10x increase in TC and overall quality of life."
"1243","This sub's work culture truly is bizarre. The subtle ways people here justify their opinions is more telling than the explicit points themselves:

Describing having an unhealthy work attitude as being more ambitious than having a healthy work attitude speaks volumes, CSCQ! The learned association of ambition with career is not usual. People who choose to work less and focus on everything else in life are just as ambitious, and additional effort spent working would be time taken away from their ambitions, folks here just can't recognise ambition that doesn't align with their own obsessions.

I also find the attempt to justify excess work as a pro-family move to be painfully ironic.

Of course, ultimately; live and let live. I just find the justifications used by communities with unhealthy work-life attitudes to be fascinating - reading CSCQ can be fascinating and it all comes out in threads like this. It's okay to just admit that increasing personal career-status and wealth provides a validation in one's life. No need to try and convince each other their hobby brings superiority or is altruistic."
"1244","A new sub might be easier at this point"
"1245","r/9to5devs someone make it!"
"1246","Can I ask what region you work in? I live in San Francisco and leetcode is literally all I'm asked from startups to larger companies. Frankly I'm tired of it; it's demeaning and feels like hazing.

Especially those that marathon leetcode questions in succession and under high pressure. Like, wtf? When I finish those it feels like my head is going to explode.

I'm currently working at a place that was less leetcode-y but I'm no longer enjoying living in San Francisco and I'm ready to move but I'm terrified of jumping back into a leetcode grind.

I just want to live a chill life in a chill place and SF is completely the opposite"
"1247","My 2 cents and ymmv New York's hedge funds and investment banks are desperate for developers, and none of them asked leetcode question, I found an awesome job in two months."
"1248","How did you go about this?  I currently do quant stuff on my own time, it works really great for personal investing.  Scaling it, running a multi million dollar fund would be very different but for now I'm happy with my alpha.

I wouldn't mind trying something like that though, what kind of interview questions do they ask?  I was toying with the idea of amazon, but saw a lot of their interview questions were very leetcode-ish.  I feel I could do it, but arrive at the optimal solution in 30 or so minutes?  I don't know about that one.  Its making me feel really stupid tbh.  What I do now works great and it consists of running into a problem, taking a crack at it and then going to google/stack if I can't get it.  Seems like once you get the hang of leetcode it becomes easier but damn its really something."
"1249","Developers/SEs at banks or funds are separate from quant/strat roles.  The dev function is mostly similar to what you'd do in tech, though obviously oriented toward finance.  Quant/strat/researcher roles require   additional quantitative training, usually an advanced degree (ie, a CS BS won't likely cut it)"
"1250","makes sense, I don't mind doing it on the side and doing dev work in the industry at least."
"1251","Yeah I'm just  dev certainly no quant. The quants need developers."
"1252","Mmhm, y'all do more hardcore programming, we (strats) still code but do more quantsy stuff as well."
"1253","Thanks for the tip, going to start targeting them more."
"1254","It's not just fintech.  Many mid-to-senior level roles in NYC prefer to ask domain questions over leetcode-type questions.  (""Many"", not ""all"", because there are always exceptions.)

Even when I've been asked algo questions here, they're of the ""Find the 2nd smallest value in an unordered array""-type of question, not the more advanced stuff you'd need a LC Premium account to see.

Take-home exams are also getting vastly more popular.... but YMMV on whether that's a good thing or not."
"1255","What are the names of these companies or how do I find them in other cities? Do I just google city financial tech company?"
"1256","Move. The San Fran tech scene breeds this ""work till you die"" toxic mentality. If you want a cushy job where you're not being pushed to 150% every day and can ""turn off"" when you get home, then move to a lower cost of living place and and look for a job at an older, most established enterprise (they tend to be more lax to the point of glacial). 

I'm 3 years out of college making just at six figures in a city where the median income is less than $50k. No, I don't live in the middle of nowhere either.- RVA is a hugely trendy ""up and coming"" city, but I've been here most my life. The food and social scene is great and that's all I care about. I was able to buy a house here last year completely on my own, paid off my student loans debts fast, have great benefits, and hardly have any stress from my job all at only 25 years old. Sure, it moves a little slow for my liking and can be frustrating with the red tape, but I wouldn't trade it over a breakneck ""up or out"" job like out West for anything."
"1257","I work in downtown SF for 40 hours with 0 expectation to work extra regularly lol"
"1258","At most Bay area companies you can just not show up for half the day without telling anyone and no one cares.

I don't know where the rumor of these companies having a ""work to death"" culture started from. I can't imagine a more cushy lifestyle."

"1263","&gt;and look for a job at an older, most established enterprise (they tend to be more lax to the point of glacial).

Even the more established big companies can push for things a bit.  I worked for a big established company recently that was changing the way they did their annual employee reviews, and they added a requirement where they wanted their employees to always be learning - So on the annual reviews, one thing they'd start to look at now is whether the employee had done any learnings/trainings, etc., and if not, that could count against you.  Also, for employee performance, they tended to believe in a bell curve where there are supposedly always some employees toward the bottom end of the bell curve, who would need to be put on an improvement plan or let go..

Also, as a big company, they had offices in multiple countries, and sometimes teams would have work split across multiple continents, so sometimes people would have to get on an online meeting after normal working hours to talk to team members in other continents."
"1264","Yeah my only expectations for personal growth is I have an annual budget of $2k I can use on courses, certifications, or conferences. Doesn't matter what it is but I have to do at least something."
"1265","yep, in Europe a lot of big companies from car to banking industry also start like a ""agile side department"" or whatever fancy name they call it. Basically something that is not internal IT development that is meant to create new thinking solutions that could be used internal and external. Then you don't even need to worry about raising series X funding"
"1266","Ive worked in SF for 8 years I would say many, many more people work 40 hours here than the ones being pushed 150%.

There are plenty of people with normal lives outside work, those who are married/kids, who hang out with friends, do sports/exercise, etc."
"1267","Lemme guess. You're a C1 SWE?"
"1268","Not even, I refuse to work for them. I even go so far as to advise other junior developers to avoid them. Incredibly toxic PR practice. Known for massive layoffs every two years because of their ""up or out"" mentality. It's just like working for a SFran company except without actually being there. I'd rather move to another city and work for someone else if they were the last and only choice available to me here."

"1272","Lot of people here are completely out of touch with reality. I have moments where Im on this sub all the time then get completely annoyed with the kids who think they know what they are talking about and take a break. Making less than 130k doesnt make you a failure. Social skills and being a team player is more important than the git gud at leetcode attitude. 

My first job payed shit but my second job payed significantly more. Not because I grinded leetcode but because I made friends and people liked me. I was able to go through one of the easiest interview processes ever and land a nice cushy and stable job."
"1273","Lmao dude thats a little disingenous saying you can just make friends and be liked. At the end of the day, a business hires you to be good and make them money. If you sucked ass at your job but were super likeable, normally youd be fired in a heartbeat for some nerd with no social skills but actually provided more value."

"1275","Don't buy into the hype.   


I stopped going to coding/dev focussed meetups years ago. Originally I felt somewhat obligated to go to these things too. Maybe to network or learn something new. They ended up being a large waste of time, at least for me. I've made better connections on LinkedIn. I've learned more through online courses and reading online documentation than through a few hours of cramming in a free evening training session.  


I've had plenty of hobbies outside of work and hopefully you continue to do what makes you happy outside of work too. If I may recommend a few: motorcycles, traveling, paintball and weed."
"1276","No, do not be discouraged. I've been a software development professional for 4 years, never opened leet code, nor went to a meet-up, and have only coded at work since I graduated college.

This sub is a tiny sample size of a huge industry. I'm beginning to code and learn outside of work now to prepare for another job. I have a family and have to balance work and life.

I handle the pressure I see here and other programming subs by remembering that (maybe) 10% of this site's traffic are active contributors to the posts we see and everyone else lurks. If we are only seeing 1/10 experiences/opinions, what to do the others have to say?"
"1277","They are saying ""oh I'm taking a break until then I'll ask my dad/mom/uncle for a job"""
"1278","Look, it sucks, but the leetcode grind is necessary, however, only in highly competitive tech hubs. Im an entry-level dev in NYC. EVERY. SINGLE. COMPANY. asks leetcode style questions or system design/oop questions. Even the no-names. I have zero FAANG aspirations, in fact Ive applied to none. The companies Ive applied to no one has heard of, yet they all conduct the same style of interview. Frankly, its madness.

And Im not just a sample size of one. Im involved in a NYC-run program that helps entry-level devs, CS students enter the field. There are over 200 students. Half of the curricula is technical interview prep/hackerrank/leetcode review! I know so many bright students from all kinds of backgrounds, colleges, etc that have sent out (literally) hundreds of job apps, that have to grind leetcode nonstop just to land a job at some no-name company (myself included). Theres dedicated slack communities to this shit. 

There are a lot of reassurances and whatnot in here, but I think thats a disservice to people who live in highly competitive tech hubs/or want to work in one. Their  job search experience is not going to match what its like to get a job in the UK or Canada or even the middle of the country. You shouldnt be scared, but you should know that if you want to work in ANY company in a major tech hub, its likely going to involve dumb leetcode style questions. Its bullshit and I hate it, but its the reality."
"1279","+1, recruiting for relevant companies in industry hubs is significantly different to recruiting for random companies outside of industry hubs."
"1280","Perhaps it's just an ""entry-level"" thing?  I _literally_ haven't been asked a typical leetcode-type in NYC, and most of my colleagues haven't.  It's usually domain questions and take-home exams for people here."
"1281","That's wild, so far it's been online coding challenges followed up by leetcode-style interviews for me."
"1282","&gt; I don't see the point in grinding programming problems for several hours

The point of preparing for DS&amp;A interviews is... to prepare for an interview at a company that does DS&amp;A interviews. If the company you're interviewing at doesn't do those kinds of interviews... then obviously you don't need to do it.

For me personally:

* I spent a few weeks before my FAANG interview preparing. I *too* never opened Leetcode in a browser! But I did review DS&amp;A in ... gasp! ... my own free time (using books and pencil and paper).
* I now work for my dream company, on what I think is the coolest software in the world.
* I earn 3x more than I did at my previous job.
* I average less than 40 hours work per week.
* I have a great life outside of work.

&gt;  or excluding everything out of my life except CS.

Nobody here has ever said anybody should do that. And I certainly don't. Again... all I did was spend a few weeks preparing for my interview.

At my previous job, where DS&amp;A interviews weren't required... I earned about 1/3 of what I do here. I also averaged more hours per week, and the stuff I was working on was mind-numbing and I hated it.

So yes, I sacrificed a few weeks of my own time studying DS&amp;A. In return I have improved the next several decades of my life immeasurably. If you can't understand why I chose that tiny sacrifice for a massive gain, then I can't help you.

&gt; How do you guys handle the pressure that you get here?

I don't get any pressure here, except for pressure from people like you implying my choices are silly and impossible to understand.

If you're happy where you are and with what you had to do to get there... fucking fantastic for you! If somebody wants to study DS&amp;A to get into a certain company... fucking fantastic for them! I have no idea what pressure you're referring to.

&gt; Should I be worried about my future.

Why do you need this sub to tell you what to worry about? Especially when in the same breath you are criticizing this sub for giving unrealistic advice?

If you got your current job and think you can keep getting jobs you want after that... then no you probably shouldn't worry.

If you want to work at a place that does DS&amp;A interviews, but you refuse to prepare for them... then yes you probably should worry."
"1283","If your employer is allowing you to learn and develop your skills on the job, you are good to go. If you are not learning and developing your skills on the job, it is likely that whenever the tech you are working with becomes obsolete, you will too. 

Our industry is in a constant slow churn of technology (with some snap changes as well). You must follow it, move into management quickly, or exit it."
"1284","&gt;If your employer is allowing you to learn and develop your skills on the job

I've never asked. I just learn regardless on the job. It's part of your job, your career.. To learn new stuff."
"1285","I get 15% of my time mandated for training,its pretty sweet."
"1286","I don't disagree at all. Some folks here don't do that or they feel too pressured by production deadlines to invest in themselves.

"1290","Graduate student here. Same. Haven't done any internship or got a job yet. And tried my hands on leetcode for a while but got instantly demotivated by the sheer number of problems and the fact that there are way too many skilled people over there who are better than me on every aspect. I'm just trying to not take all these too seriously and just focus on my personal projects and learning as much as I can on my own. Hope that the future will be kind to me. But honestly leetcode (and other competitive coding websites) seems like a way too sophisticated thing with nearly not as much use. But that's my personal opinion."
"1291","&gt;demotivated by the sheer number of problems and the fact that there are way too many skilled people over there who are better than me on every aspect.

You dont need to be the best, theres plenty of demand for cs people. Even those who are working at average or below average companies are doing better than most people outside the industry."
"1292","This gives me hope. Thanks"
"1293","This gives me hope too.

Thank you!"
"1294","You don't need leetcode and you don't need to work for FAANG. Lots of great jobs in the software industry that would gladly have you."
"1295","Don't quote me on this but... Even at a FAANG, you're not likely to use much more complicated than a hashtable on a regular basis.

My work life balance is pretty great. There is some pressure to stretch yourself (especially around performance review time) but I'm not working 60 hours or anything.

I also was in the startup world before where Leetcode was not something that most people did, and it was totally fine too. Making the jump to Big G was something of a long term goal of mine for quite a while, so I put in the (pretty significant) effort to get through the interviews when they came calling. But it's totally not required. I keep in touch with folks from previous (startup) jobs and they're plenty happy."
"1296","Most FAANG job interviews don't require anything harder to understand than a hash table. Occasionally you'll get thrown a legitimately hard interview question, but more often than not you're not even expected to finish it, but rather to do a good job communicating your thought process.

A few companies have high bars, but it doesn't take that much in general. The interview cycles take time and can be frustrating, but it's surprising not that hard to get in with a few tries."
"1297","FWIW my SWE onsite interview involved graphs twice, concurrency once (system design), and a trie. Maybe I got the dreaded interview antiloop though."
"1298","At the end I believe it all comes down to what your hobbies are and what you like to do in your spare time. Some people like to keep learning new technologies at home, or maybe do some LeetCode just for the sake of learning. Then there are people who like to disconnect from work and forget everything about software development. And then there are people who are like a mix of both. They like to hang out with friends, family, etc but still find the time to learn new technologies. There's not only one way to go in life. Just choose whatever that works for you."
"1299","This sub doesnt represent anything I know. Im in the same boat - I never code outside of work. I love spending time with my family, reading and playing video games occasionally."
"1300","Your doing it the right way. 

Your more than your TC .

Half the posts here are ' I'm so alone, I have no interest at all aside from coding and non of my co workers have even offered to arrange me a marriage' 

It's more important to do real social things, ( Snapchat and Tinder don't count ) and to build real friendships. 

Enjoy life"
"1301","I'm UK based, 10 years in, never done leet code or attended a meet up or hack day outside of work (have been to a couple where I was required to with work).

As long as you are continuing to learn on the job, and staying on top of things, you should be good, just have a look at the market every 6 months or so and try and stay relevant, but this doesnt mean you need to attend meetups or grind leetcode.

A lot of companies use the same libraries, frameworks and technologies, they're looking for someone who is capable and a good fit for the team, not someone who can smash out leetcode questions.

Granted I don't work for a FAANG, but I'm well compensated and provides me with a lot of time to do the things I actually want to do, and as I get older thats what I'm starting to value more."
"1302","I don't do that stuff either. Neither do my coworkers. Even my friends from school who went to FAANG companies only did that stuff for a couple months to prep for interviews. 

I can't answer the question if we're doing the *right* thing, but I can say based on the amount of recruiter emails I still get on a daily basis... I'm not worried.

Edit: possibly relevant, I've been out of school working for about 6 years at small companies in a non-tech-hub metro area (Philadelphia) yet I've never had trouble finding a job I'm satisfied with at all. I understand it's different if you're aiming for extremely competitive areas, but I specifically can't be bothered with those types of atmospheres and prefer a laid back (if less cutting edge) working environment."
"1303","I graduated and found a job in the first 4 weeks. I practiced a bit of leet code, but for the position I'm in now, never had to do any leetcode questions. Throughout my schooling for 6 years, I worked on projects that interested me and it helped build a good skill foundation for coding. Some weekends I spend time working on projects and tutorials to accelerate my learning. I'm working on the front and backend of a rather complicated realtime data application. The subject matter of the app isn't as exciting as self driving cars or building software for space exploration, but the work is challenging enough to keep me interested. 2 years after graduation, I am a technical lead for Android development and work on frontend and backend .NET.

The great thing about this industry right now is that job seekers have a lot of leverage because the skills are in such high demand. Which means if you don't want to make your entire life all about your career, you don't have to! Just show up to work and make an effort to do a quality job, make a decent living, go home and live your life how you see fit. If you want to do a little extra sometimes, it can help accelerate your career if you choose your subject matter carefully.

Hell, if I had started in this field much younger, before I had a family of my own, I'd be able to save soooooo much money that I'd just save and invest. I'd be much better off, and already have a decent house with a decent sized nest egg already in my mid 30s.

If you aren't into the competitive CS world as a student, practicing on leetcode and going to hackathons, don't worry about the big tech companies. That is stress you can do without. If you wanna try, make your best effort but don't expect to get in. There is plenty of work out there beyond big tech that pays quite decent. If you're worried about enjoying what you do, well, work is work. What makes the biggest difference in a work place is the work ethic culture. Some places demand more of you than you want to give, others are relaxed and understand that you want work life separation. The company I work at is more the latter, and again, was never asked a leetcode question. What probably got me put ahead of other candidates was my portfolio webpage that built displaying my academic accomplishments like my GPA (3.8) and my projects, both academic and personal.

Definitely practice leetcode. Definitely invest time and effort. But you don't have to make it your whole life. Hang in there and keep applying. Sell yourself on your soft skills as much as any technical skill. Be confident in interviews, and try to prepare questions for your interviewers because that is always impressive when a candidate appears to know what they are looking for out of their working environment."
"1304","&gt; I never opened Leetcode in my browser

I don't know what this means

&gt; never went to a meetup

Me either tbh

&gt; and I only code at work

Lots of other people do this too....that's called having a life outside work. I think you'll find that plumbers don't go round in their free time looking for toilets to unblock.

&gt; I have a normal life outside of work and I can pursue great hobbys where coding is not a part of.

Awesome!

&gt; Should I be worried about my future.

No.

&gt;I don't see the point in grinding programming problems for several hours or excluding everything out of my life except CS. 

Agree.

&gt;How do you guys handle the pressure that you get here?

If a company is trying to make you do this stuff on a weekend against your will, then they're a shitty company. Lots of people have side-projects that they work on outside of work (I do), some of those are code based....and some aren't. For example, I have a bunch of GitHub projects...but I also play with 3D printing, my wife and I enjoy watching movies and hiking.

As other people are saying - this sub is a bubble. Stop reading these stories about people who sleep under their desk and work 48 hour weeks, then go get drinks with their coding bros after midnight and live at work. 

TL;DR: Leave work at work. Enjoy life outside work. Have fun. A job exists so that you can do things you enjoy in your free time."

"1321","The competition is ridiculous, but the expectations for new hires are absolutely absurd. Im in NYC and it took me 5 months after graduating to land my first role and after getting laid off a year later it took me 3 months to find another job. While I wasnt grinding leetcode much I was still grinding nonstop(applying to jobs, learning relevant tech, udemy courses). I was on my computer for like 8-10hrs a day trying to get a job. Only to get some interest from companies that wont pay more than 75k, which is absolutely nothing in NYC."
"1322","This sub reflects the competitive tech hubs or areas with significant industry outside of FAANG. I'm not just talking the bay area either. For those who think that isn't the case, go check the market and apply to positions you don't have an inside connection to. You might be quite surprised. 

Interviews outside of this trend I've been through were normal but were locations I didn't want to live in. Companies in most tech hubs seem to be outsourcing their hiring for developers and those groups are mirroring processes used in the bay area. The companies' HR groups are none the wiser but there's likely enough competition that people jump through these sort of ridiculous processes. There are exceptions you just have to dig around awhile."

From that perspective, i didnt really care what hoops i had to jump or whether i agreed with the usefulness of the challenges or not

I generally come back to this sub to offer advice if i can and celebrate the wins of others who struggled too.

The obsession with money and prestige - just ignore it. If thats what makes some happy, to each their own. If you know what makes you happy, should be easy to ignore the things you dont find helpful here.

"1349","i dont get why this sub scares you? its mostly young people asking how to get a job. i dont get it. you have a job."
"1350","Why does a subreddit scare or pressure you? Why are you so insecure about your life choices? Maybe see a therapist first.

Every other day there's posts like these asking for validation about not trying for FAANG. If you want to work at a FAANG, go for it. If you don't want to work at a FAANG, don't."
"1351","[deleted]"
"1352","second guy who's mentioned this today.  What is it like up there?  Currently in Northern Virginia.  Seems a lot of companies are doing the leetcode thing.  I've been doing solo projects (stock trading) for awhile and its been great, very stressful to make everything on your own though so I wouldn't mind a 9-5 that offers similar comp for a bit.  Talking with amazon though, they wanted the leetcode stuff right off the bat."
"1353","yeah wtf is leetcode?"
"1354","Sub scares me too. Keep doing your own thing my dude!"
"1355","I used to be obsessed with the big companies right when I got out of college but now that I've been out for about ten years I'm pretty happy living in a low cost of living area in the suburbs in the Midwest. Sure I may not be building annex Google maps but it is great to be near family."
"1356","For better and worse, this sub is 90% guys who want to play the FAANG game. There are many other people out there... they just don't post here often except for the occasional ""I've been in the industry X years and this is why I hate this sub post"" ... and the cycle continues.

My suggestion: read the good posts here and/but set your own goals."
"1357","That's normal. If you're happy where you are, there's no reason to constantly strive for something that you don't even know if you want. The most I do outside of work is read books and articles related to the tech I work with and general things about software engineering (Clean Code, for example, or other project management/refactoring/etc. books).

I have no interest in FAANG so why waste my time preparing for it when I'm well-prepared for any other ""normal"" company interview?"
"1358","Is it this sub or the web in general ? it seems a lot of crowd is communicating a lot on being leet to the power of hacker."
"1359","Thank you for sharing! Im currently a junior in CompSci and this sub was making my senior year seem stressful."
"1360","Omg not at all, I've been in the industry for 10 years and I never required all of that, I've worked with great companies and faang follows me every year asking me to interview, which I don't want because I have a great job and no need to kill myself for their objectives... Don't worry of what you listen here"
"1361","Well, for me it was a couple months of high pressure grinding leetcode and prepping for interviews, which led to a great offer at a rly good company doing something I really want to do."
"1362","Jesus christ, this is actually a dream of a post. Reddit seems to really inflate things and only ask ""well why aren't you earning 80k+ in central London after 3 years experience"".

Does actually make you feel inadequate as like OP I'd never touched leetcodes until about a month ago, and now according to these poxy recruiters, most companies in London use them in interviews.

Best advice I can give on anything, is to do you. Accept a salary you're happy with and dont compare to other. If you need to do a few algorithm based leetcodes based on interviews then crack on but if not who cares, it wont be used day to day.

Redit is just one big subtle brag"
"1363","The meetup stuff is mostly if programming related things are your hobby. You'll be fine without them. 

The leetcode grind is a temporary investment of time if you are or expect to soon be on the job hunt. It's just a fact of the industry in many places and you are largely doing yourself a disservice by not practicing."
"1364","Nah, this sub's culture is largely focused on the competitive, high-paying roles. If you live in a good city finding work won't ever be all that difficult for you (if you aren't an idiot that knows nothing). That being said, there are quite a lot of companies who will leetcode you, so when you go looking, you should prepare. The first job is the easiest to get, IMO. They don't expect you to know much. When you're going for non-entry level, they will likely put you through at least a few tasks to verify you're not a mouth-drooler. But, even then, a lot of the time it's minimal. An easy leetcode (basic string manipulation or some such). A discussion about how you would design a system. Some conversation about technologies on your resume. Nothing insane.   


If you want to step into known brand companies, you should be prepared to compete. And the rewards are pretty substantial comparatively. 6-figure salaries, great bullet points, travel for enrichment benefits, the chance to speak at conferences, develop expertise in significant technologies, exposure to cutting edge architecture designs, etc... But, if you just want a 9-5 with an OK salary, you can always get that if you're willing to move for a company."
"1365","So many of these posts keep cropping up. Like geez, a big part of this career is searching stuff up and filtering all the things non-applicable to your specific use case.

Its not that hard really. Ive been a part of this sub for almost four years, since I was a sophomore in college. Before we had 100,000 members. Theres plenty of valuable information on this subreddit. you just need to take the time to look for it, instead of just looking salary sharing threads, or am I doomed clickbait posts."
"1366","I usually just skim through and skip the leer code and try hard CS posts. No offense to anyone who finds that intriguing and pursues that approach in their career. I mainly just read the posts that are relevant to me and that I can relate with or contribute to. 

Im in the same boat as OP,I have never done leetcode, dont do meetups. I have a family, I code personal projects that solve issues for me while learning new frameworks or to challenge myself. I do some custom raspberry pi setups, and diy house stuff. To each his own."
"1367","Not at all, unless you have reasons to believe that you will need to do that for something that you might need in the future (i.e. your job scope requires it, or you are interested in moving to a company with an interview process that involves training on LeetCode)."
"1368","I take everything with a grain of salt and usually do not take everything I read on here seriously."
"1369","Congratulations! youve achieved being a normal human with interests outside of work! Dont sweat it."
"1370","I'm like you most of the time. But once a year I decide to do a couple of interviews at other places just to keep myself sharp. I like leetcode because it's fun AF, and the nature of interviews has changed so much from gotcha questions to actually meaningful questions that reflect how it's going to be to work there.

As for meetups, a lot of them are a waste of time. You should do them when you're new in the industry though, because you'll get an idea of what everyone else is doing in your city, and where all the other jobs are. I'd go to some maybe once every few months. 

But really, meetups can be a waste of time unless they are on a topic you care about, or by an organization you find interesting. 

These are optional activities you can do to keep your career instincts sharp. I've been in this industry for a decade, and I've realized jobs don't last forever. I worked someplace for five years and one day all of a sudden my whole team was out on our asses. So it's important to keep those instincts sharp and a network going. You don't ""need"" to do them, but they are to save your ass when life hands you a tough one."
"1371","Been in the field for 3+ years now and my experience is the same as yours. Nothing to worry about."
"1372","It might not matter in the job, but it will in some interviews with big companies.

I had to do 2 programming challenges from Facebook. And then 2 more on a whiteboard in person. Obviously leetcode here was good for that preparation.

And literally NOBODY in this sub thinks you should be grinding leetcode for the job. ONLY for the interview."
"1373","The Leetcode, Odin Project, Project Euler suggestions tend to be for people who express anxiety or a genuine newness to coding. I would say for someone who's still a student like me, it's pretty sound advice. But if you're comfortable in everything and still feel pretty sharp, yeah don't worry tbh."
"1374","There are many ways to define success.  You should do you and compare yourself to the goals you want to attain within your career.  There is no point in comparing yourself to others because they have different career goals than you do."
"1375","Do y'all have any internship/new-grad-full-time opportunities there by any chance?"
"1376","Are you me?  You might be me.  


I've worked for two different companies in the almost 2 years since graduation, getting promoted at the first job.  Each job was more interested in whether I could design a working complex program, model to UI.  They were also more concerned about my fit socially with the team.  


Is the work I do challenging?  Not particularly.  But I'm still getting paid well enough to enjoy a fantastic Lake Michigan view while paying down college debt.  More importantly, my life isn't dominated by CS."
"1377","Honestly, what you have seems pretty normal. I have a friend who is very similar to you, except he used to do projects and hackathons a lot. After finally getting a job and doing it full-time, coding wasn't a fun thing for him in his free time. He's ok with coding at work and not at home and that's totally ok. 

Some people genuinely enjoy it to do it at work and at home, but that's understandably not for everyone. You'll be fine."
"1378","90% of the advice doled out here is from people who have demonstrated they have absolutely no idea what theyre even talking about.  More often than not, this sub is like a bad Hollywood version of what its like having a career in computer science.  So, theres that."
"1379","I've long ago stopped actually paying attention to this sub, unless I have a specific question. Then it's probably been asked before, so I just search it up and see what the answer was. If I listened to half the posts here I'd have already quit.

Actually there was one time I had a specific question about resume building, I asked it in the weekly thread, and nobody responded to it at all. So that was useful."
"1380","Most people love to exaggerate or lie about how busy they are, enjoy your life and dont buy into it."
"1381","Sometimes you have to remind yourself reddit is full of 19 year olds who have no idea what they are on about."
"1382","Coding is not my life. Work is not my life. Sure - if you love it go ahead and do it in free time.. nothing wrong with that. I don't do that. I enjoy going to the gym. I enjoy hiking. I enjoy swimming in the lake. I enjoy nice restaurants. So you can be sure that when I get home.. work stays at work. And so does coding."
"1383","I agree, and I haven't done Leetcode or gone to code meetups.  One thing I might say though, is that many people who go into computer science or software development actually enjoy it - which means sometimes, some of us sometimes like to work on our own programming projects *as a hobby* outside of work.  But it doesn't mean you should exclude everything else out of your life.  Personally, I have other hobbies &amp; things I like to do outside of work, but sometimes I have an idea for a software/programming project I'd like to work on.  I've been working as a software engineer since 2003 and I still occasionally have ideas for small software projects I'd like to work on in my free time.

I've even seen some job postings where they like to see any personal side projects you've worked on in your free time because you enjoy it.  That helps to show what you're passionate about."
"1384","Well I can only speak from personal experience, but some of us have an underdog complex and don't have the pedigree of some college graduates. I grind because I want to reach for the apex of my career and never have to worry about job security. I grew up in Detroit, where I have seen a sprawling american metropolis collapse into dust all within the span of 4 years of High school. I don't take anything for granted and I grind to be the best."
"1385","You dont need to grind Leetcode unless you are looking for a job at specific companies. If you are happy with your job and work life balance, theres nothing to worry about. This sub is mostly filled with people with time on their hands or those in college/looking for a job."
"1386","You know I've been only working for a couple months at this FAANG company and I thought everyone would be grinding grinding grinding. However, literally they don't do anymore coding outside of work. They enjoy life and maybe code a LITTLE bit on the weekends for their side projects. Some do LC but maybe like an hour or two a week is the max they say. They don't care that much because there's more to life then just working and work. Realistically a lot of people enjoy life and this sub is the echo chamber of grind and grind. Which works well(ish) when you're looking for a job (I did the same grind study plan). However, once you're working a 9-5 in tech there's no fucking way I'm literally gonna go home and be like WOW I really wanna do more coding. You need that reset button to keep you going in this long term game. That's what the senior dev's told me when I was getting a little worried even when I just started."
"1387","As long as you're not writing shit code other people will have to bang their head against later on we're all good brother

If you're one of those coders that push out shit code just to get stuff done and get paid then fuck you

Code lives on a lot longer than we'd all like, and working on a shitty codebase is so fucking depressing

At least my coworkers are very good at their job and I love learning from them

People who don't give a fuck, don't want to learn anything and don't want to teach are the fucking worst

Being a proper developer is definitely not a one stop shop thing like working at McDonald's where you'll learn everything you need to know in a few hours"
"1388","Yeah man this sub is filled with a bunch of weirdos which is why Ive never really taken stuff here serious lol. Im still in school right now and Ill be graduating in June but Im already working as a part time software engineer and itll become full time once I graduate. The only time Ive done leetcode was when I was applying to FAANGs but even then I wasnt obsessed over it like my life depended on it. Ive never any internships or side projects and idk even where tf to find a meetup. I essentially fucked around in school and partied hard lmao but I had an amazing college experience socially and academically which is what honestly matters the most because youre young once. Im one of the two persons in tech in my social group and we dont talk about tech like its the only thing in our life. I dont think about cs/coding outside of work or school and Im still living a great life. I mean Ill be making more than my siblings and parents combined so I guess I turned out alright."
"1389","No, you should not be worried.  Leetcode is a great resource for interviews and to get you sharp for a situation where you can be asked any technical question in any context.  That doesn't do much to make you good at your job, it makes you good at interviewing and solving new clever problems.  Meetups and other industry events are nice to haves and can help with networking (also mostly beneficial for interviewing and job searches) as well as giving you new ideas for your job but aren't necessary.  The only reason to worry is if you start to lose the ability to do software related tasks outside of what you do at work because you ""overfit"" to your daily tasks."
"1390","Dude the majority of people here are in school still.  If you have a job already, youre set.  When you move jobs in a few years, I almost guarantee they wont ask you any leetcode questions outside of basic data structures questions to make sure you arent lying on your resume.  

Asked both my managers of 20+ years experience and they both agreed after a few years of actually building stuff in a team, no one cares if you can pull an o(1) solution for a hard graph problem off the top of your head lmfao"
"1391","You will be able to answer this question for yourself once you start to look for a new job one of these days.  Either you find one fairly easy or wonder why you are not getting offers and start to try to get an edge by doing LC and other things."
"1392","A lot of people are doing leetcode and stuff at work.  I did at my last job."
"1393","A lot of people suffer with this, but the reality is that you should only get into the industry if programming is your passion and your willing to spend the time.

If you aren't having fun programming I would recommend that you take the hobby that your working on now and turn it into a career.

If you do that.. I guarantee you will be happy."
"1394","Just a little advice. If you and I are talking at work and I say, ""Wow. That's not right"", there's a good chance that you'll hear my tone, see my body language, and start to laugh along with me.

If you only see, ""Wow. That's not right"", it always comes of humorless and negative. This is an aspect of writing, not intent. So even if this sub were not a negative mind hive of self-perpetuating pubescent squawks and burned out wailing, it would still sound that way when you read it.

Go forth and stay happy. Your career is yours and yours alone. Comparison is the thief of happiness."
"1395","Maybe some people want to make a lot of money by doing leetcodes and getting a crazy job"
"1396","I mean if you want to be a 10xer you can grind in the off hours practicing and learning as much as you can, working on your skill like an athlete. If you just want to take it easy and collect a reasonably high salary with pretty good job security you can do that too. You get out what you put in, its up to you"
"1397","This sub is filled with highschool.idiots"
"1398","Never did leetcode and never got a college education. Recently got an entry position with decent pay and good opportunity to learn. Ive considered going back to school to improve my math.

You dont need leetcode"
"1399","I don't read this sub but I do follow it so it pops up on my feed once in a while. I have been coding 26 years, a product of the 90's and early internet. I have watched the digital change throughout the decades. The reason I code today is not the same reason I coded back then. Back then technology was freedom, you could easily be self employed and have plenty of clients. Today it's much more difficult because of the maturity of WYSIWYG editors and the sheer number of ""coders"" that are available, not to mention outsourcing all around the world. 

Back then I pursued knowledge of technology obsessively, coding 30 hours straight with the exception of naps. Often I would get back up sit at my desk and pick up the same cup of cold coffee right where I left it a couple of hours before without even looking at the cup. Code was life. Did I miss out on a lot? Yes I did but I also gained significant skill. 

Toxic culture exists in the workplace period. The issue with technology is that most people don't understand it and that creates complicating factors. Businesses only care about the bottom line so when they make a decision it is based on the hours and number of bodies they are throwing out something. This tends to breed technical debt which compounds future projects. 

Why do I code today? I have been doing it so long I can pick up news technologies easily. The logic and patterns are ingrained in my brain but it's also malleable to stay up to date. So coding today is very easy after all that time. I also get paid assloads of money to do a job that's not that difficult for me. If anyone gives me shit and it's unwarranted though I push back. 

If you are just starting out my suggestion is that you should get some more experience working with skilled people and then start your own company. Try until you succeed it may take 5, 10, 20 different tries. You will be much better off in the long run."
"1400","I think of leetcoding as enjoyment..."
"1401","&gt; Should I be worried about my future?

Read the signals at work. Is your team hiring? Is the company doing well this quarter? Are senior managers leaving unexpectedly? Is management constantly raising funds to meet commitments they've already made?

In my case, I accepted a job in another state not realizing that virtually the entire full time employee team left, except for one person who got promoted into management basically by default. Another warning sign was a senior (semi-retired) manager discussing the fundraising hole roughly the size of my salary. If that doesn't sound like you, that's great! Take a deep breath and relax buddy!

&gt; How do you guys handle the pressure that you get here?

If the pressure is bad for you now, consider what happens after job loss. I discovered this sub while job hunting. I'd been laid off from the non-profit I was working at, and decided to break into the 'for profit' world. I knew about CTCI from my tenure at the other side of the interview table grilling undergrads for campus jobs, but this sub gushed about LC.

&gt; I don't see the point in grinding programming problems for several hours or excluding everything out of my life except CS. How do you guys handle the pressure that you get here?

So except in extraordinary circumstances, you shouldn't bother grinding programming problems or skipping trivia night. I never did more than an hour of LC a day. The purpose was to brush up on python3, which I thought works quite well as a whiteboarding language. Realistically, I didn't change my life that much during the job search. What really changed was what I did during working hours. I generally spent an hour every day on the following tasks:

0. Interviews as scheduled  
1. Select a job opening, write a custom cover letter and apply  
2. A single Leetcode problem (sorted by difficulty)  
3. Find one or two new companies and new roles to apply to, and add it to The Spreadsheet  
4. Read a journal article or book chapter on a technical subject  
5. Watch a conference video  
6. Work on a project  

That about covered the work day, and left me with nights and weekends as usual. I did get out to more meetups, but lemme tell you that is more of a mental relief after 8 hours of 'working' from home.

These days I do maybe one LC a week, on the clock. Because most of my day is spent reading other people's YAML file changes and yelling at devs to  fix their bugs that took down production, I need a small, focused task to work on to keep my skills ready. And if the network goons report back that I'm LC'ing at work, so much the better. Best to keep management on their toes \^_^"
"1402","Honestly, I only code projects and not leetcode becuase I would like to get better coding.... plus it challenges me to think about new things, new ways of approaching and new apis etc etc.... Plus I live in an area where there is not much tech so I want to build my own app to sell....and this does not mean I have a life either...."
"1403","You only live once, so just do what makes you happy."
"1404","I did several interviews, had no coding whiteboard interviews and got a job as machine learning engineer half a year before graduating with a BS in cs. This forum is nonsense and only applicable to people wanting a job in silicone valley. Ignore people who go on about leetcode. Its mostly a waste of time as those problems are really only useful in interviews that ask leetcode questions. Its not always the way companies decide who theyre hiring..

I got my job because of my GPA, internship experience, and how I spoke during the interview."
"1405","It sounds a lot like showing off for me, tbh. You don't need to gear yourself up for leetcode questions and you have a normal life, while others dig their heads into the questions, and getting anxious abt missing one leetcode solution at interviews. And when you say you don't see the point of devoting completely in CS -- hey, when it comes from someone having their dream job already, and that you didn't need to go through the pain of leetcode and all, and describing others' effort like that, it just sounds condescending.

No leetcode and getting your dream job; only code for work and have a life outside -- perfect balance of being an expert at work, and expert in life ---- I don't know what there is to complain about. Or you're not complaining you just want to share the joy, idk."
"1406","Maybe the problem with all these desperate leetcoders trying to land that 'dream job' is the lack of life balance. Maybe if ya'll learned to lead a more balanced life even as you're leetcoding and preparing for the interviews you'd relax some and not fuck it up as a nervous wreck on interview day."
"1407","You have lazy programmers and ambitious programmers. Software development is both a path to get a good base salary and a path to high salary and notability. I am a lazy programmer. Don't get me wrong, I am not slacking at work, but I usually just want to put in the 7.5 hours work (8h - 2*15 paid breaks).

I go to the tech event every month. It is a free beer and as a quiet extrovert the forced interactions are great for me."
"1408","The fact that you go to a tech event every month is proof you aren't a 'lazy' programmer. You are putting in that little bit extra. I also am not the super-ambitious type that lives and breaths machine instructions 24/7, but I do read programming topics, go to programming meetups every month. The way I look at it is trying to 'level up' certain skills that I know are important to my career development, but not any more than that. I am not going to stop reading some biography or history to read another programming book."
"1409","I work for a FAANG. I only used leetcode a week before my interview for 2 of the FAANG (F and G) and passed both. None of my co workers used leetcode like people do in this sub. I feel like people here are approaching this the wrong way."
"1410","I ignore it, it's a bubble.

I have 2 kids under 4 and am as of about 10 weeks ago a single parent. I'm an experienced Python developer. I work a bog standard 8 hour day, but after that my time is for my kids. I love what I do, but my life is more than code."
"1411","Just chiming in to say you're not alone. A job is a job and passion is a passion. If you're passionate about programming and computer science then sure, knock yourself out. But if you're like me, who's studying this solely for the purpose of a better, quality life (so basically a tad bit of ""survival of the fittest"" thinking) and your passion lies elsewhere, don't feel pressured by these trains of thought. Be smart about it in order to make yourself happy and those around you."
"1412","The amount of outside project people suggest are nightmarish. Apparently some companies/hiring manager expect you to live and breath code like a robot"
"1413","Don't use Reddit overall as an indication of what normal people do. Reddit is very much so a place where over-the-top nerds congregate and will super confuse you on what life for normal people is like. 

Most of the advice here only really applies if you're trying for your first job at a big n. Otherwise you just make sure you know how to talk, and can handle normal programming questions that are relevant to the job you have to do. 

In most real-life situations, you're not really going to have to name the perfect algorithm off of the top of your head or any of the other nuts stuff people talk about on here. Most languages have a standard library with perfectly good versions of these data structures / algorithms. You just have to pick what you want to use based on the situation.

Even with the side projects: you shouldn't necessarily have to do a bunch of side stuff outside of work unless you're trying to make a stretch for your next job and you want to demonstrate your skills for potential employers or you want to improve your skills personally. 

There are jobs outside of Google and Facebook."
"1414","I wouldnt stop reading this stuff. But you dont need to spend time doing any of that leetcode or extra programming curricular stuff except if you want to find a new job, I think."
"1415","I disagree with those who say leetcode doesnt matter and spreading false expectations. In a world where children as young as in elementary school are being taught how to code, if you dont practice leetcode or whatever coding platform thats in fashion, they will. The bar is higher than ever before even for entry level positions, and it will keep getting higher as a lot of the hiring process continues to get automated away by AI. 

You have a very good reason to be scared if dont invest time to keep up with the trend in order to survive in this industry."
"1416","I learned in college I didnt want to do coding as a job, got into IT, sysadmin, now cyber security. Still wouldnt take back that CS education, still knowing the basics about code and how computers work is foundational. Seeing the code level of stuff that make the bigger things work. Writing code? No I learned in college after many all nighters of debugging....... Im not doing this 40-60 hours a week. Wasnt a natural either. I do plan on starting python beginner stuff this year and want to be good at that even if its not relevant to my job. Java, C, C++ was what I started with in school. Java was the main for the CS program. If thats also your path, start studying for those relevant certifications jobs ask for."
"1417","&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  I never opened Leetcode in my browser, never went to a meetup and I only code at work. And you know what? I'm super happy with that because I have a normal life outside of work and I can pursue great hobbys where coding is not a part of.  

After graduation, I worked at one place for 4 years. While working there, I was happy, outside the work I was enjoying life. I never went to any meetup neither bother to learn anything new outside of the work. While at work I learn Perl , C++ and did C programming. After 4 years due to restructuring my position got terminated.  

When I was looking for work, one thing I realized is I didn't had 4 year experience but 1 year + 3 x 1year = 2 years only. I didn't learn anything new that can help me find the job. This was eye opening for me. After that I start reading book and start going to meet up. This help me build network and learn new ideas. See how others are doing.  I always think this way if my position is terminated today. Will I able to demonstrate new skills? You might not want to learn how to solve leetcode problems. But you do want to advance your programming skills."
"1418","I have fifteen years of experience in this field. This kind of padding is more necessary if you aren't finding jobs that stretch your abilities and give you something interesting to learn. I consider learning on the job to be part of my compensation, and am earning somewhat above market for my location, role, and experience. 

Do this kind of work outside of your job when you stop learning on the job long-term, if you feel like it, or if you perceive a shortage of opportunities and want to fix that. Interview annually to keep your interviewing skills up and to assure yourself that your skills are in demand, if you have energy. But as long as you are happy with your opportunities and are growing, you are probably fine."
"1419","Most of the CS world doesnt browse here. If they did, many of us would feel like shit for not matching up to the Masters Degree with concentration in AI, intern at Google and Bill Gates personal fluffer making 230k @ age 24 type people you see posting here

Most of us are like you, we do our job then come home and do other things.

I wish more CS people would try govt or contracting cleared jobs. A TS clearance takes a little over a year to get and you can hit 130k within 3 years easy without any coding tests."
"1420","You're just a normal person, don't worry. CS doesn't need to encompass your life. Years of experience is enough to get you into a lot of jobs and probably will continue to do so for a long time. Most people who code aren't as good as they think they are and good engineers are always going to be in a shortage."
"1421","I think some people are more passionate than others. Theres nothing wrong with that but the advice that leetcode is a must for hours daily is not accurate but merely projection. 

Depending on ones goal to work for certain companies, that may be necessary for a short period  of time in preparation for an interview. And maybe brushing up on skills but to do it everyday? 

If you have to keep leetcoding, something is wrong. Sure practice is fine but if you dont  master the basic concepts let alone truly understand them, then theres the problem. 


Let them do what they want. Its their problem how they want to use their remainder time left on this planet.

Theres a reason that theres only 2.6k billionaires out of a 7 billion+ population worldwide and it isnt leetcode. 

In the grand scheme of things, many fail to see the purpose of life or get carried away in so many things. I saw the same thing in high school and college. People stressing themselves to get an A+ so much that they forget the purpose of learning. Not to mention toiling their health in the process. 
They go crazy if they get an A or even A- thinking their life is over. 

One dude actually had a lot of gray hair from stress. They memorize, binge and forget instead of learning and applying. In the end, those people didnt even go to any Ivy Leagues. Sadly, Im seeing the same mentality here and in other areas of life. This is more common but not exclusive to first world countries. Regardless of the school or job you have, the road ends the same. 

People have had strokes or even dropped dead from work related stress. Same thing with the gym. Take it from me as a warning. Ive seen this in my personal life. You cant buy your health back. Ask many of the wealthy men who were on their deathbed. 

Theres a time for everything and knowing the balance is key. This is not solely applicable for work but for life in general.

Work smart, not hard. 

My advice to you? Take the advice here with consideration but also with a grain of salt. Ask people in real life in your industry to confirm said advice or receive relative advice in your stage of life."
"1422","What's wrong with going to the gym?"
"1423","Why do we get these posts every 3 days?"
"1424","I don't view the success stories of others as personal indictments to my own self worth. Instead, I choose to be inspired by them.

They applied for how many jobs? They continued preparing for technical interviews after how many rejections??

Ultimately, people are just posting information. How your process that information is completely up to you."
"1425","Why are you even here if youre satisfied with your career?"
"1426","To help other people perhaps? If it was just people without jobs helping other people without jobs, this would be a pretty shit place to go to get questions answered, right?"

"1430","Software engineering is a commodity now. There will always be work for you. How much you want to get paid will depends on what you do outside of a job."
"1431","Commodity? What percentage of the population knows how to code? I dont think this is anywhere near a commodity."
"1432","Yeah but whats your TC...

As for being able to handle the pressure. I don't feel any pressure I genuinely love programming/math and it is not a chore for me to read random books about Rust, for example, or do programming challenges for fun."

"1435","Total Compensation"
"1436","Lol you leetcode for just a few weeks and you have way more free time in life because you make way more money at FANG and can retire earlier / afford to take long vacations and nice trips"
"1437","Great. I lack domain knowledge and I'm not sure how to gain it without actualy working in the industry. Then there are requirements given in job ads or interviews. For example time series keeps coming up and it's a topic I personally like as well.

Still ""supervised learning"" is a huge subject. For example I heard about Gaussian process regression just a few days ago from an employer.

&amp;#x200B;

Ironically my scientific research uses mostly unsupervised learning (clustering) but SL methods come up much more in job ads."
"1438","The amount of domain knowledge needed is dependent on the domain. For example, if you're doing data science at an e-commerce company, it shouldn't be too hard to learn that domain knowledge compared to something like biology/healthcare. IMO the important part here is getting a job in a domain that you actually enjoy.  
  
&gt; Still ""supervised learning"" is a huge subject. For example I heard about Gaussian process regression just a few days ago from an employer.  
  
Agreed. When I started, my mentor told me to pick an algorithm and become an expert in it. I went with gradient boosting because it was the most popular and one of the best algorithms for handling tabular data (which it still is). Starting with a complex model like gradient boosting made it easier for me to learn other less complex models. I use gradient boosting (LightGBM package to be exact) for almost every model I build. It works great and there is good packages for determining things like feature importance so you can gain insight into how the model is making decisions compared to a black box model.  
  
I've done unsupervised a couple times and that was really more for exploratory analysis purposes where were trying to see if there is certain segments in the data. I also used this for an RFM analysis once and it worked well.  
  
For me, in the beginning I mainly stuck to topics that I could apply at my job which helped because I could implement them on real data. I'm actually working on a book idea that will give a learning path for beginners and then another book for going from junior developer to mid/senior level. I'll keep you posted on that."
"1439","Great advice. In terms of topic I like time series most, and they are very useful too. But in terms of an algorithm, I'm not sure yet. (ARIMA is becoming old school!)  GB is very interesting for sure...and so are RNNs. And sure, please keep me posted on your books."
"1440","The problem with an unranked list is that it makes each item seem equally important, and/or that the effort to learn (or ""master"") them is equivalent. They are not. 

Any new-grad stats PhD out of school probably has exposure to every single item on that list, and probably has ""mastered"" 70% of those, if by mastery you mean know it better than say 80% of data scientists/analysts. The only things they probably don't have much exposure in that list might be SQL and productionization. Beyond a certain point, there are common threads. 

However, that doesn't necessarily make them the perfect data scientists. You don't really need mastery of everything to be effective. You need to know how to drive business value to be effective, you need to know how to work effectively in an organization, etc. 

So stop worrying about how everything here relates, or if there's an ""optimal"" subset that you should learn. Learn what you want or need for what you're doing right now. Get an entry-level role/internship in the field, or otherwise get exposure to what data analysts/scientists do their job, and over time you'll figure out what's important, and figure out what level of ""mastery"" you actually need for each. These vary a lot by industry, role, and region."
"1441","Yeah that must be why corporates want candidates with industry experience. I feel I'm too old for an internship but I just applied for a postdoc position that involves using ML for an engineering project."
"1442","So knowledge of data frames, linear/logistic regression, and hypothesis testing are essential.  All the other things?  Who cares?  Write decent code.  Know applied statistics."
"1443","I would have to do a factor analysis to figure that out. =D"
"1444","Your IB skills with Excel will translate well for most analytics roles. You've already been working in analytics and simply have to upgrade your toolkit. My recommendation is to focus on the pandas library of Python to replicate work you would do in Excel. (Vlookup to pd.merge, selecting columns and rows, pivot table to groupby and pivot_table).

A large amount of not majority of data scientist roles are analytics type roles."

Classic research / IO PhD -&gt; R

Methods / more complicated Research / big data / ... -&gt; Python

But a bit of everything might be a great start. Don't forget to enjoy your life though :)"
"1447","I think a little more of a dive into excel would be valuable (vlookups, if statements). Whether you like it or not youre almost always going to have to work with excel even though your data cleaning should almost always be in R/Python. As you mentioned basic SQL is valuable.

Some kind of viz tool (tableau, google data studio,etc.). Most schools offer a free version of at least one of the major visualizations tools. 

Also regarding R/Python - most shops Ive spoken to use R  but Id say getting a sample survey data set and running some of the different analyses (regression,t-tests, cluster analysis) you learn in school will be valuable. Have to be careful about you how you about learning it because a lot of the online classes dont use HR datasets so Id recommend practicing on one of those from the jump. 

Also, these are all company/industry specific. I know some people in finance that have never used SQL but its definitely a good tool to have. 

Feel free to message me if you have any other questions Ive trained multiple interns, workforce analysts on developing these skills."
"1448","Learning to write functions for data cleaning and quick exploratory analysis in Python using pandas has saved me tons of time I would have wasted in Excel. Though you can probably do that in R as well. But I dont use R.

Also, learning how to utilize APIs and web scraping might be useful depending on your job."
"1449","Thank you! Are there any specific functions on data cleaning youd recommend?"
"1450","Its hard to name anything specific because there are so many and it rlly depends on your needs. I usually write my own functions with the built in methods pandas offers so I would just recommend a tutorial on pandas.

But heres a cheat sheet from data camp I find myself referring to a lot: 

http://datacamp-community-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/dbed353d-2757-4617-8206-8767ab379ab3"
"1451","In R, you should learn basic data structures, data types, indexing, filtering, vectorization, control structures, and the apply family."
"1452","In addition to what everyone has mentioned here I want to mention the little known but super powerful data tool of a good word processor. I prefer Sublime Text but many will use Notepad++. There are so many uses for programs like these when analyzing data. 

1. You can use them as a code check (you tell it what kind of code you are writing and it does highlighting).

2. You can do powerful find/replace commands. I have taken rows of Excel strings that I want to convert into a comma list for use in R that take seconds to format in Sublime. Find and replace ""\n"" "", "" to turn every new line entry into a comma separated list that can be copied and pasted into R/Python.

3. Ctrl+Shift+K otherwise known as multiple selections. You can edit in more than one place at once. It works as a quick substitute for find and replace, or to apply the same sequence of changes to multiple lines simultaneously. Basically, let's say you want to add the same text to 40 lines of code but in different places. You can multiple select all the places you want something then type it out and it appears in every selection space.

4. It doesn't use those damn fake quotation makes like Word does. So you can copy and paste into terminals, programs, etc. without worry that it will give you an error since Word uses non-utf-8 quotation marks.

5. Tabs. 

6. Save on exit. 

7. Looks cool. 

8. You can brag to the other nerds around the water cooler about some new hotkey you learned."
"1453","Good advice. I write pretty much everything in np++. I love how it saves my stuff even if my battery dies. I never charge my laptop at home, so I often sit down, dock my machine, and realize it died."
"1454","Got laughed the other day by a ""data scientist"" consultant... he was trying to tell me that the more people paid for a service, they were more loyal to it because they saw more value in it.. they measured it by churn. I asked how we didn't know it wasn't the other way around, that consumers who were less likely to churn also were willing to pay more, and that as you raised price you scared away more churn-likely consumers.. a few blanks stares later and it devolved into me explaining to the fellow the whole causation vs correlation fallacy in statistics."
"1455","You had me at consultant"
"1456","There tends to be an inverse relationship between the size of a consultant's paycheck and the value they generate... so yes, they're probably making good money."
"1457","This has to be why I failed as a consultant. I just could not sell people on our data that would never do what they wanted it to."
"1458","Honesty is often times at odds with profit.

Hell, having known a lot of hustlers making a good living through questionable channels and activities, I almost wanted to say honesty is actively forbidding people from becoming wealthy."
"1459","For ""profit"" defined broadly enough to include political power-building of mid-level managers looking to make a name for themselves."
"1460","Yeah, any sort of personal gain, really."
"1461","Generally no, but its consulting company for sure."
"1462","I laughed out loud at this comment. I would give you gold if I had money. Lmao."
"1463","Yea, it annoys the hell out of me because I am a consultant and I actually have a mathematics and STEM background (chemistry and biology), and these jokesters come along with their few coursera classes claiming to be knowledgeable.

Or my wife who is a data scientist and has a masters in statistics and operations research. The team's she is on is really good, but when she has to work with contractors, they encounter some like that. It's just like... How did you manage to get here?"
"1464","I've decided the only people who put actual value on coursera (or website of choice) certs are people who have never done them. You can basically turn your brain off, half-ass it, then get the cert.

I'm of the opinion it's better to ask to see a few projects they've done. Even if they're just personal side projects, it's still better than some online certificate from courses of varying rigor and use."
"1465","It's true that many days scientists aren't particularly knowledgeable about statistics. However, I've started to see more and more job postings for statistically literate people, especially people with knowledge of causal inference (what I believe to be the next hot thing in data science/analytics)."
"1466","Then I hope that I am still on the right track with my MA in Economics and Data Science, as the topic of causal inference / stats plays a decisive role here. I always thought I would have to add a second Master in CS to be employable in DS at all. :)"
"1467","Econometrics (well Econ as a whole as well) and Data Science are so well-poised to come together... Look up Susan Athey. CS is a great skill of course, Python and maybe some R development knowledge (not just DS) will make life a lot easier. :)"

"1469","Thank you very much for your recommendation! This is precisely the research that I think will establish itself in the field of economics over the next few years."
"1470","Judea Pearl would agree with your opinion. He wrote a whole book on that issue."
"1471","Yes, Pearl and his do-calculus is one of the theoretical frameworks related to causal inference. The NeymanRubinHolland model with potential outcomes is another. Moreover, at my old university they were studying some sort of hybrid framework that would combine graphs and potential outcomes via so-called ""node splitting""."
"1472","I got very interested on this, do you know the name of the researchers or could you at least give me the name of the university so I can look into it? (For the node splitting part)"
"1473","Sorry, I graduated years ago and that work was done by my professors in recently started research projects, so I don't know if anything has been published yet. However, it seems like others are trying to combine causal graphs with potential outcomessee for instance: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331670633_A_Potential_Outcomes_Calculus_for_Identifying_Conditional_Path-Specific_Effects.

More specifically, node splitting is at least discussed here, but I can't say if their approach is similar: https://youtu.be/NpNTfvbE1gY."
"1474","Thomas Richardson and Jamie Robins, Single World Intervention Graphs. Theres probably some YouTube videos on it."
"1475","Have worked with a guy who got in the top 5% in multiple Kaggle competitions. He was self-taught, haven't heard about t-test, and had very vague ideas about causation. Still helped us to develop a complex data pipeline, designed a couple of models still used in production, and finally got poached by a competitor.

In my experience, having a good statistical foundation helps, but it is not mandatory, especially if your task is to provide predictions, not inferences."
"1476","Honestly I think this entire discussion is about prediction vs inference. As you said, statistical background isnt a total necessity when tasks only consist of prediction. Who cares about q-q plots when all thats being built is black box models?"
"1477","I guess the issue arises when management/outsiders start to conflate prediction with inference. I recently helped out with a clinical research project where the the lab interpreted lasso selection as an oracle for finding the true ""important"" predictors. It was difficult to explain to them the lack of any statistical guarantees of the variable selection, especially given that we had *p &gt; n*.

I've heard many data scientists say that communicating the results is a huge part of the job, and I think it's at least important to be able to address the inferential limitations of predictive black box models."
"1478","Check out some papers by Chernozhukov and Belloni on Lasso. They show that in a p&gt;n setting you can get causal inference by doing something called double-selection in Lasso."
"1479","And isn't anything above linear/logistic regression essential a black box? 
It's my opinion that if you need a complex model be it tree based or deep learning, then your data simply is very complex and you can't make any simple conclusions from it that you can directly implement in real-world."
"1480","And this is why in bioinformatics (and biology in general), we always have to go validate our results in the lab. The discussion is always, ""Yeah, cool, so you found 10 major driver genes... Did any of them actually work though?""

It's a pretty interesting debate we have, because sometimes good statistics just doesn't work in the lab, whereas some, not *bad*, but, less than ideal, statistics finds ""real"" hits."
"1481","Forgive my ignorance but isn't inference important when doing predictions? I'd love to hear where this breaks down as I'm not knowledgable enough about statistics."
"1482","To my understanding... The difference is the *focus*.

Inference is more concerned with the ""why"" and digging into the relationships between things.

Like finding the extent to which age affects the probability of someone not defaulting on a loan.

Inference is useful for decision support. Like... ""Variable A is the main reason why we lose customers. So let's target that to reduce churn"".

Whereas prediction is a ""proof is in the pudding"" focus. Even though prediction is built upon inferential statistics.

So the focus would be in accurately predicting who will default on loans rather than the ""why"" behind each particular variable.

However... with the credibility and explainability crisis I expect that a greater focus will be on the why questions in the near future. More and more regulation will be in place forcing data scientists to explain how and why their algorithm made its decision. 

So I think in the future, the simple and models with explainable outcomes will tend to triumph for most business use cases. Those algorithms will stand up to audits and would facilitate things like a customers right to know why they were denied a loan.

This may not be a 100% accurate explanation, but according to Cunninghams Law... if its not then we will know soon."
"1483","As you said, often times the two are intertwined, interpretibility is huge area of research for a reason. You need to explain why you made a prediction, and inherent to that is some implicit causality.

I don't think it means that nn and tree models are going away, but understanding how to interpret models correctly is part of the prediction skill set imo."
"1484","I suppose this is exactly why DS folks shouldn't de-emphasize inferential statistics."
"1485","Hear here!"
"1486","Aye aye!"
"1487","On a completely un-related note.....

Your flair says that your a DS in Healthcare.

Can I ask what your background is and how you got into Healthcare as a Data Scientist?"
"1488","I'll dm you."
"1489","I'm a PhD in the biosciences trying to learn data science as well; so I'm curious too :)"
"1490","It can matter if you want to know the best levers you need to pull to improve the prediction (in context of the model).

E.g. -- deciding compensation for hiring one more sales persons with background knowledge X results in Y sales."
"1491","The thing is, data science is a broad field. Those who have all the skills are extremely rare. The best thing is to get a team that has all the skills and have them work together."
"1492","I agree. We also have someone like that and he developed end to end solutions and delivered it to the customers beautifully. A large tech company in SFO area poached him. This person had a very basic stats understanding."
"1493","I think it's about the right domain.

Prediction is *wonderful* if fundamental things about the world don't change. Marketing response prediction works great until bad press hits (e.g. Wells Fargo). It's enormously difficult to pivot from reduced form models (typical builds for prediction) to structural models needed to disentangle deep parameters -- and even those aren't fool proof!"
"1494","This discussion is as old as data science and it's very close to discussions in CS about 'real programmers'. I will tell you something as someone, who worked in data science for several years: statistical theory in data science is pretty overrated. It's not that you don't need it, but what you describe is not a lack of understanding math, it's a lack of common sense and domain understanding. 

Data Science at the university is research oriented and in the industry it's pretty rare, that you are able to dive deep into methodologies. Usually understanding your domain is much more important. Furthermore, visualization and storytelling are the most important skills as a data scientist in advanced analytics. The truth is, that data science is not different to other roles. In the end it does not matter if much if your findings are 100% correct as long, they look impressive to your stakeholders and just work. 

When we look at predictive analytics, it gets even more interesting. People build models, which predict the cause of a feature or include data leakage and promote the huge accuracy model as breakthrough, without being skeptical. You dont need a deep understanding of stats, to understand that it does not give you much benefit to use these predictions. In the end the model will just not work.

The good thing is, all these wrong assuptions and results are usually discovered later on (A/B tests, KPIs, whatever) and you learn from it. I doubt that statistical theory helps you to avoid all these mistakes in a **time-efficient** way."
"1495","I guess you are right in with this example, but the general message, should be clear."
"1496","I feel like this discussion blows up monthly in our sub and the consensus never changes:

Yes, most data science training is woefully inadequate. Yes, exceptions do exist. Yes, data science is poorly defined. etc. etc. etc. 

Unless someone can bring something new to the table, I dont understand why this discussion keeps getting upvotes. Genuinely, can someone answer why? Am I missing something?

OP, to be clear, Im not complaining about your post specifically. Im complaining about the meta in our sub."
"1497","Why is this subreddit so concerned with ""gatekeeping""? I've literally never heard of that term until I started reading this sub"
"1498","I love data science, but I don't have a strong enough background in statistics to actually be a True Data Scientist "", this sub's only acceptable definition. In a way, this sub was the reason I put my plan of a masters data science in the back burner because I wanted to focus on stats more. But when you put it this way, I guess I'm being foolish to wait until I'm completely ready to be data scientist.

I guess, eventually, all niche skills will evolve enough that you won't need in-depth understanding to be in that profession. You don't have to know formal languages to be an IT Admin, or you don't have to have a masters in finance to use an accounting software."
"1499","You need to get out more into more diverse groups if this is the only place you've heard of gatekeeping"
"1500","Really? r/gatekeeping is several times larger than this sub, so that's suprising."
"1501","It's a common term -- just means setting up standards (usually arbitrary and unachievable). A reverse ""no true scotsman"" as it were."
"1502","Oh you haven't heard of gatekeeping? Welcome to data science. It's filled with gatekeepers."
"1503","I don't really see complaining about people who call themselves Data Scientists having little or no knowledge of basic statistics as ""gatekeeping""."
"1504","You're missing something fundamental here. If people were just looking for a simple answer to a question then very likely they would Google the question and get the answer. in the context of Reddit that means they would search the Reddit threads and get the answer

However, in this and many other subreddits people are looking to have a discussion. They're looking to explore the issue, discuss the complexities in general and perhaps how it may relate to their specific situation.

You state that the discussion might not have any merit unless something new is brought to the table. how would you know if something new is brought to the table unless you have the discussion?

It's my experience that most often you do not find valuable, previously unknown ideas just coming out of the woodwork completely formed and ready to go. In my professional life these sorts of rare and valuable original solutions or perspectives come from discussion amongst peers and colleagues. How could we ever do that if we limited our topics to things that were not already discussed previously.

Ultimately, Reddit isn't stack exchange. It's a forum for discussion, a place that people talk about things. I talked about a lot of things before that doesn't necessarily mean that I don't enjoy or benefit from having a discussion with someone new."
"1505","Considering how a significant portion of our community is people trying to break into the field, I think it's healthy to have a periodic reminder that statistical expertise needs to be a part of the professional expectations for the role. Further, I think the data science community is overdue to come up with new language to differentiate what we used to call a data scientist, and the ""data analyst *plus*"" qualification that has been lowering the bar."
"1506","Yeah, unfortunately when people want to get perspectives on something on Reddit, their impulse is to post first rather than search first. 

(Or people *do* search first, read relevant comment threads, still want to make their own thread on the topic, but opt against referencing all the existing perspectives they've just read? Seems unlikely, but it is a possibility)"
"1507","I can't remember where I read it, but it was basically the same thing you said.  It applied to 'big data.'  Basically, the gripe was that there was a lot of data, but the necessary assumptions about the data and analysis often aren't being examined leading to heavily biased results and spurious correlations. 

My problem with 'data science' in general is that there is no real definition of what constitutes a data scientist as opposed to a statistician.   This can be seen in the various curriculums being offered for data science and the job postings out there."
"1508","I know what youre talking about, but dont forget that data science is extremely broad and somewhat ill defined. 

You appear to be talking more about inference than straight-up prediction, which can be two different animals. 

The thing I see missing from the data scientists I work with is the *science* part. Theyre great coders and they understand the math and the parts to get models to work, but they dont seem to grasp the scientific process, which is as important as the modeling."
"1509","What are they missing in terms of scientific process though?"
"1510","Causal inference is separate from predictive analytics. 

In predictive analytics you don't really care about what the coefficient mean, as long as it ""works."" Much more mathematical.

While causal inference relies more heavily on domain knowledge IMO and you ONLY care about the coeffiecients.

One is about Y_hat and the other is about beta_hat.

Also, at least for business data, adding in a ""few controls"" isn't any more robust. You need to control for **everything** to have causal inference, usually by some type of experimental design."
"1511","I would argue diff and diff is causal inference, when experimenting is impossible.

I guess maybe moreso, arguing that you only care about some coefficients. In my econometrics class, our diff-in-diff was a regression coefficient."
"1512","Yep! The techniques behind D-D aren't insane. An experiment is basically a D-D by its nature -- due to random assignment, the initial diff is approximately 0. D-D is definitely a *part* of causal inference, not the sum-total. Apologies for lacking clarity."
"1513","One of the small number of ""most important# things I have learned in my 20s is that there are,very very very few people that actually know what they are doing. This goes for all ""experts"" across all fields.  It just seems to be this snowball effect of human nature where people to want to look up to someone as an expert, while at the same time people getting literally high from the praise.  What results is a bunch of people who think politicians, scientists, doctors, etc.. Are these anti-human superhero geniuses who are immune to criticism outside of their field.  And this happens on the micro level to.  Pretty much all of the typical heroes the MSM and school systems like to prop up were horribly flawed in reality.  

So ya. This obviously ia happening in ""data science"".  Theres too mich breadth and not enough depth.  I'm an expert in 1.5 things. Goalkeeping for sure and Food Service Operations in a general customer service operational standards sense. It took me being a literal genius and about a decade of experience in both to accomplish that.  Once you really know something well for the first time, you realize how hard it is to do and how few people have ever achieved this.  Probably 1 or 2 out of 100 ""data scientists"" really know what they are doing.  Probably a few more than that are experts in some subset of the field.

Specifically though, my Masters in Data Analytics from WGU focused quite a bit on statistics.  They didnt require you to memorize it, and I certainly didn't, but it exposed it the statistixs to me three different times in three different ways.  I know enough to know how much I dont know in the field, and what I would need to figure out to accomplish some sort of meaningful model. 

That all being said, the whole field is dangerous.  So many managers and users of this data don't want it done correctly.  They dont want to pay for the resources to produce something that, if done correctly, likely will tell them they might be on to something but probably need to spend more money to get a definitive answer if its possible at all.  They just want to be able to pretend to be using the new trend for vanity reasons, or they just want to pay someone to tell them how good of a job they are doing and how their current projects are supposed to result in better financial performance.. Regardless of the actual truth behind it.. Which is that in reality its almost impossible to do this with accuracy.  I say that meaning with how projects tend to be aligned.  Obviously in theory, and sometimws in practice, you can define the question narrow enough with solid enough underlying data to draw meaningful conclusions. Its just extremely rare."
"1514","Do what they are paying you to do, understand their perspective as much as possible, provide your perspective about how doing the process the right way might be better for the company, and if needed look for a new job."
"1515","Originally ""data science"" in the industry became popular as a discipline for more predictive applications in which causal inference doesn't play a big role, and was previously dominated by classical statisticians using SAS. CS/Engineering folks got an edge by just using python, xgboost and modern development practices, especially in tech companies.

&amp;#x200B;

Following this success and all the buzz, corporations started to hire the same type of people to do all data stuff that was previously dominated by analysts using Excel (these guys are falling for these statistical fallacies for ages, the only difference is that their methods are shallow enough to management with some business feeling to call BS on them) - including applications where causal inference is central. Not only that, many corporations just started to rename whatever they called their Excel analysts with ""data scientists"" to attract employees.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, technological buzzwords won't solve causal inference - in fact they could lead to more BS vendors going undetected and I'm afraid that the movement in overall with harm more than benefit society in the short term."
"1516","I think that there are many types of Data Scientists and many types of jobs/companies. In some places deep statistical analysis is necessary, in others it isn't required.

&amp;#x200B;

In essence this is a question: is data science/ machine learning a glorified statistics or not?

Or: is causal relationships or quality of predictions ? (as many people in this thread already said)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm biased and think that the quality of predictions is much more important for business.

\---

* It is true that you could design a great experiment and make a study of variables, you could look for multicollinearity, run statistical tests and do other things. It would work and be really important in some cases. But if we talk about practice, it is much easier to train gradient boosting model, which doesn't require such assumptions as linear models.
* Sometimes people say that gradient boosting models are black boxes and can't be understood. I disagree - there a lot of tools and technics to do this like LIME, ELI5, SHAP, partial dependency plots and other things. Of course they don't reveal causal relationship between variables and target... but they show how changes in the variable will influence the target which is good enough.
* Also clever technics can replace old tools at least in terms of efficiency. For example it is important to check that the distribution of variables in training data is similar to their distribution in the new data. We could run statistical tests to compare distributions... or we could use adversarial validation.
* And all of this was about ""research"" stages of the projects. When we talk about putting models in production, it is much more important to write good code and pipeline, make a reproducible machine learning project. In companies with developed infrastructure the models would make predictions automatically, their performance would be monitored, if there are signs of model deterioration, then the models would be automatically retrained;
* Also I suppose this discussion is more relevant to classification and regression models. What about recommendation systems? Graph networks? Deep learning on texts and images?

Nevertheless I agree that it is necessary to have at least some knowledge of statistics and common sense. I saw cases when people made serious mistakes due to the lack of critical thinking. But this is more about critical thinking than statistics."
"1517","I work with Data Science since 2015, this profile is very common unfortunately. When I started to work on Data Science it was on the field of Natural Language Processing and I have a really brief knowledge of statistics.

Now, after some years, I have more background on probability&amp;statistics theory, as I completed the course of Probability&amp;statistics and Stochastics Processes on the college (Computer Engineering course).

But even more common than that it's data scientist that cannot build software, but only jupyter notebooks. In my view is not a worse problem than not know anything of the theory behind, but well... programming in data science is a serious skill too.

As you said, there is more interesting in making the models seems pretty than correct in the analysis view, but I would said that remains the same at software engineering architecture.

For all that reason, I think building a culture behind Data Science is very important. This year I created a Project Template to help on that."
"1518","As an aspiring data scientist, this is something I know I am lacking in.

What would you recommend someone like me, who is trying to improve their understanding of statistics, do? Are there any good online sources, or should I just grab a few books and drill down?"
"1519","I'm gonna be frank with you: statistics is a difficult subject, and it takes some time and effort to learn it, so while there are some online sources to learn particular concepts, I really think that you would benefit from a book that offers a more structured approach to the topic.

Regarding a good book for learning some statistics, it depends to an extent on what field you want to work, but for the basics I think that it shouldn't make that much of a difference. It depends on what math background you have, but if it is low ( or non existent), I found the book ""Statistics for Business and Economics"" by Newbold et al quite easy and aprocheable when I took my first course in statistics, and it should include most basic topics of probability theory and some regression.

 In adittion, if you are interested in regression analysis you can't go wrong with introductory econometrics by Wooldridge, one of the most useful books I have ever used, quite comprehensive and easy"
"1520","I'm a BS Economics student and Wooldridge is indeed a great book to learn linear regression and panel data (longitudinal for statisticians). For time series I think the best book would be Gujarati. For some reason I got some difficult with Wooldridge approach.

By the way, I took my econometrics classes almost a year ago, I remember the theory quite well, but the proves like how to get the estimation of the betas in linear regression using matrices approach is one example I don't remember. Do you think this is important to know or I'm good remember just theory?"
"1521","Depends what you plan to do. If you wanna go into academia  is something quite important to know. If you are going to the private sector to a work that is mostly applied stats or econometrics tohugh, I don't think knowing proofs by heart is that valuable. Knowing the intuition of the concepts and what that proof is supossed to show should be more than enough (at least if you are not on a really technical position, but you need a PHD for those anyway)"
"1522","Which Gujarati book are you referring to? Basic Econometrics?"
"1523","Yes. That one."
"1524","Personally , I would recommend  Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data
By Wooldridge. 

This a little more advanced text but it help to really understand the model . I find his introduction book not enough too understands the key concept and this book talk about other regression type than just OLS ."
"1525","A second opinion, but if you're focused on predictive analytics and more ""CS"" applications of data science (NLP type stuff or deep learning), I don't think learning causal inferences is useful for you, beyond knowing what your models DON'T do."
"1526","I've worked for 40 years now (not in data science), having graduated in Comp. Sci. in 1978, and agree with many of the comments here - especially that very few people really know what they're doing. Real experts understand that and tend to be the most modest people you will meet -- unlike bullshitters. As someone said, the more you know, the more you realise what you don't know.

A good data scientist really needs it all - excellent software development skills, good stats knowledge, good data skills, good inter-personal skills and domain expertise -- which is almost impossible.

I'd like to add something about programming. People who are not trained in software development generally write bad code. There are exceptions (both ways - I've seen Comp. Sci. graduates who can't program) but, generally, you can tell the educated programmer from the rest. Really good programming skills are often under-valued in debates about what makes a good data scientist."
"1527","As a decent programmer, the recruiters have funneled me into a career as a data engineer, instead of data scientist.

These companies really believe a data scientist's programming skills don't need to be any greater than the ability to run scripts in Jupyter notebooks."
"1528","They're wrong to think that. But, on the bright side, doing data engineering for a while will help you in the long run because you will gain insights into data science that the people who take shortcuts will never have."
"1529","It jumps out of the code when you see a good (trained) and bad (untrained) programmer. There is an art and science of programming that is immediately apparent when you look at their code. It's relatively easy to get code to ""work"" but the elegance and efficiency (and maintainablity) of the code is something else. Also, untrained programmers really can't produce complex code. Their bad practices even confuse themselves when they try to do something clever with code."
"1530","Hi. I noticed that you said that people not trained in software development generally write bad code. I am in my second year of an undergrad degree in Mathematics, so I'm not being taught software development in school. Do you have any recommendations as to how I can acquire good software development skills? Are there any textbooks or other resources that you have in mind?"
"1531","Can you do a class in Comp. Sci.? A programming class, taught by a computer scientist? There is a science and art of programming that is really only appreciated by specialists. It's been so long since I studied computer programming that I don't know of any contemporary resources. But I would advise being taught by a specialist and not a self-taught person.

Many scientists (statisticians, physicists, etc.) are self-taught programmers and their coding skills are poor."
"1532","I agree with you, most of the information I find focuses on the pipeline, but stays away from the stats. 

I'm not sure of the stats of hiring but I imagine that people who don't know what they are actually doing are not the average hire."
"1533","I even work with someone who is like this.   
She makes really great figures, but she doesn't understand the machinery behind the algorithms she uses or how they should be interpreted.  
It's too easy to pick an algorithm, generate a pretty picture and use it justify your ends."
"1534","I am really trying to know how would that work. Like any algorithm we pick must be based upon what we are trying to achieve. isn't it? 

For example:
So let's say there is a huge n available p is also small and we let's say don't have care about interpretation of data but just want to predict an outcome. 

Now in that case wouldn't linear regression would be bad. A more flexible approach would produce much better predictors. So how could she decide which algo to use? I am having really hard time picturing the scenario.

And what if the variables are correlated. How do someone with no stats account for that?"
"1535","Throw XGBoost at it, I imagine."
"1536","More or less this, yeah. You can infinitely divide the real number line."
"1537","I know this isn't the place to rant but here's something related to what you said. A friend of mine and myself graduated with PhDs in a biology field in 2017. I had already moved into a more computational subfield and had taken graduate statistical analysis courses. By the time I graduated I had about the equivalent of a masters level training in stats based on the projects I'd participated in (based on other statistician friend's evaluation).

Well jump to one year later and my friend is asking for advice about how to learn more stats. I give them some resources and next thing I know see they have finished a data science ""boot camp"" (whatever the fuck that even means) and now their LinkedIn says Firstname Lastname, Data Scientist. Holy shit, they know absolutely nothing about stats and got hired by an insurance company for their data science lead. Meanwhile, I've finished my postdoc and can't find a job in tech for the better part of 15 months. Now, as if to taunt me, I see their LinkedIn posts as they updates their progress on basic level R and Python online courses, ""Yeah! Just finished the ggplot course. Yeah! Just learned how to do linear regression! #DataScientist""

It makes my blood boil.

All these people flooding the industry with no knowledge or experience whatsoever and it's affecting the hiring of people like me who genuinely know what their talking about and are trying to make the transition to industry. I realize not all boot camps are alike and not all students are alike but this has to stop. Most companies are figuring out now that ""data scientist"" is an essentially meaninglessness term that will eventually be broken down into coherent jobs over the next decade. But in the mean time, data science will continue to be an utterly empty term that has become the new buzzword for marketing departments."

Far, far too many people entering who never learned proper stats. Maybe I'm bitter because I sat through a bunch of lin. algebra based stats courses in grad school and then did a few years of field work before I started doing anything remotely like 'data science'. I also taught myself the theory behind ML methods rather than just learn how to import a pre-trained model and every time I hear how ""AI"" is magic and we are going to ""get the low hanging fruit with an MVP!"" it honestly makes me want to quit my job and go be a monk somewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I actually am employed with 'data scientist' as my title and I feel I'm fairly compensated but it took a long time. Not a bootcamp + a short internship. And I don't even think I'm really that good! I'm p. jealous of some of my coworker's knowledge. Thankfully the boot camp types tend to bomb out of interviews where I work just given the nature of the questions and who's typically asking them.

&amp;#x200B;

If I had to make an analogy, I feel like ""Data Science"" as a degree and doubly the bootcamps are like putting someone in a wood shop with every tool you can imagine, and teaching them how to use each tool one by one. And at the end, expecting them to be able to build an armoire even though you never taught them how to actually make anything, you just taught them how to use a saw."
"1544","Because, at this point, it is cheaper to run an A/B test than it is to critically design and review an experiment."
"1545","You can't A/B test everything."
"1546","Don't get me wrong, I think you're right in that there needs to be *some* statistical backing to making statements such as ""sales increased by 10%"".

I think there are two issues:

**In a lot of cases, the time/effort/cost of setting up an experimental design that would allow you to conclusively make that statement is prohibitive.**

Example: I worked on a project where we were testing the impact that a pricing initiative would have. We were asked to look at both the impact on margins and the impact on volume. Simple enough.

The problem is that there were so many moving variables that it was virtually impossible to control for the right variables and maintain a meaningful sample given that we were restricted to a specific geographic region for testing. If we wanted to get a clean read on the impact of the project, we would have needed to control for salesperson, customer type, purchase type, purchase frequency, assortment, specific item, channel - just to name a few. More importantly, we only had like 200 customers to work with. 

This is all on top of the fact that we worked in an industry that relied on about 15-20 other commodity markets, all of which were liable to fluctuate and impact both sales - and definitely margins. 

When you really got down to it, there were more moving parts to this project than we could reasonably control for. Which meant that no matter what type of experimental design we came up with, odds were that we were going to get an inconclusive answer.

So that's half of the equation: you literally may not be able to get a clean answer without spending a ton of time  testing - and because of the speed at which business and business innovation happens, if someone thinks the idea is good in principle and seems promising at a high level, no one is going to stand in the way of it. And that is because...

**The risk associated with rolling something out which has already been developed is normally low**

Let's say you ran some high level numbers and you find that you grew sales by 10%. You know in your statistical heart that it is really 10% +- 15%, and there are about 10 factors that could caveat that growth. But all in all, you tested the model in reality, you saw 10% growth based on some sort of simple test/control design, and the results look more positive than negative. Not good enough to bet your life that they are sustainable, but good enough to bet someone lunch that they are.

You roll out the program and it turns out that when you expand it to the full set of customers, that +10% you saw before become -1%. You find out in rolling it out that there were issues that didn't impact the initial set of customers that are a problem now. Or maybe some of the efforts required of your workforce don't scale as well. Or maybe you just got lucky during testing.

Whatever the case may be, *the cost to pivot away from this project and/or improve it to address issues is much lower than the opportunity cost of not going after 10% growth.*

To divide that into two parts:

1. When something doesn't work because of a design flaw, there are almost always process + execution considerations that can be taken in order to address that. It's rare that a concept that held water from a conceptual and testing standpoint cannot be fixed/addressed when it runs into issues.
2. Worst case scenario, you jump ship. You ax the project, take the loss, and move on. And in expectation, you're better off if 50% of the time you hit on a +10% growth project, and 50% of the time you cut your losses and move on to the next project than if you wait to have extensive enough testing to convince yourself that you are 100% going to see growth.

Again, this is not true in every industry - there are industries where, because of the speed and magnitude at which business happens (i.e., high frequency, low magnitude), you are 100% better off setting up a good testing protocol to make sure that whatever you are seeing can be as close to certainty as possible. Example: if you're Amazon and you want to roll out an improvement to your pricing engine, you 100% want to test it to the point where you are 99.99% sure that you will see positive returns, because you have the platform, business model, transaction frequency, low testing risk, high production risk combination that makes it all work out in the favor of good, fundamentally sound statistical testing.

But when you're talking about industries like B2B, with huge transaction values, low transaction frequency, largely offline sales platforms, opaque market conditions, dependencies on maybe multiple commodity markets, loooooong sales cycles, etc., then you're not going to get a nice, clean environment on which you can run such testing.

Having said all of that: I agree with you that even in those cases, it's better for someone to choose the best possible experimental design out of the options available. I have seen, even in those circumstances where there are a lot of ""as right as it's going to be"" options, people who choose the categorically wrong way to evaluate a program."
"1547","You raise a lot of good points. It's true that there's many moving parts to an analysis or data science solution and that you might be unable to control for everything. But your statistical knowledge is still useful since you were able to identify these problems and eventual weaknesses of the proposed solution(s). 

Someone who just knows how to maximize AUC by any means necessary won't be able to identify these problems and their solution might look good on paper, but could be useless in reality. 

However, I'll concede that the skill set we are talking about isn't purely statistical, it's closer to general data science knowledge/experiencebut sound statistical reasoning is an important part of that skill set."

We all how businesses work: people want to  have some sort or tittle? Let's sale it. They take some coursera courses, some datacamp workshop and now they feel they have became a data scientist. 
Now, have you count how many online courses/YouTube videos / blogs are about data science? How they all promise to teach you? Funny is that many of them copy from each other, reproducing mistakes and of course, omitting all the proper statistical basics, all the theory. It's all really applied, no deep theory, no sustain.
It's becoming really hard to take serious the label of data scientist. I don't really know what to expect from them."
"1551","Companies : ""Maybe if we get PHDs theyll be better?!?!"" How about you understand what the fuck the thing is that youre employing people for. Do most data scientists even understand what the generalization of a standard linear regression is?"
"1552","Can confirm. From a consulting and data provider firm. 

I am astonished at the clear lack of understanding of basic foundations of creating quality datasets with sound methodologies and then presenting said data to an audience. 

They feel because they know the subject matter of which the data represents, that they know the data. I find this laughable because to me it's not really about what you're trying to analyse (like footballs), but how you do it and the underpinning ""science"" behind the data.

I raised this point in objection to the placing of a particular person on a data platform creation project only to be shot down because ""they know the subject matter and you don't.""

"1555","I think it just depends on job scope, if your goal is to build software that makes predictions, little to no stats is required but visualization, programming are critical.

"1556","In my experience, when people learn to use basics in a few Python libraries (ex. pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn,...) they start to call themselves data scientist.

You must have a very valid reason to remove even outliers. Removing data is highly frowned upon when doing data analysis. There is a word for it: fishing. 

You will get ""real world"" data without having had any control on any potential influences. 

When you find any sort of statistical connection between one variable and the other and it is actually causal, you were just lucky. Sure, the math shows it is ""causal"" in your data but that does not mean it is in the real world. 

It is not a mathematical problem, I am sure you know your maths/data wrangling, it is a methodological problem with the majority of data ""science""."

On a main route.  I'm not standing in 27 degree temperature for 40 minutes to help beta-test Metro's tracker system."
"1579","Yeah, bus operations/data quality definitely needs work. It's not uncommon for [\~15% of scheduled bus trips to be missing from WMATA's real-time data during weekday morning rush](https://twitter.com/dcmetrohero/status/1214584753355141120), for example. Hopefully this is something Metro and the region takes more seriously soon given [this subject is touched upon in the actions plans of the Bus Transformation Project](https://twitter.com/jamespizzurro/status/1215339818143617024), but we'll see."
"1580","Who are you who are so wise in the way of science?

Seriously though, do you work in transportation, or is this just a hobby?"
"1581","Lead Developer of [MetroHero](https://dcmetrohero.com) here. It's just a hobby. A really, uh, annoying hobby where you get to learn all the things wrong with transit data and operational challenges at agencies like WMATA, but can't do a whole lot about it. ="
"1582","Buses get stuck in traffic and seem to attract more crazies than the metro. Have had numerous buses not show up at all or pass the stop completely. The drivers often are unprofessional. And a metro plus walking or uber can get you almost anywhere here without the previous mentioned annoyances."
"1583","The Metro doesn't have to deal with traffic *shrug*"
"1584","And the stations are warm!"
"1585","I may be in the minority here, but I actually enjoy the Metrobus system. It's useful and fills in a lot of gaps that the rail system doesn't cover, and as long as BusETA is accurate (and not using ""schedule data"", which I hate because that's always bad news), it's pretty much accurate."
"1586","I enjoy it when there is a bus running relatively close to my departure time. I just hate opening my bus app to see no scheduled buses or a bus in 30+ minutes."
"1587","I only use the schedule if I'm leaving a station. If I'm headed to a station then use a tracking app like DC Metro Transit. Once in a blue moon there's a ghost bus but it's pretty spot on."
"1588","I mean, why pay $10 for an Uber when you can just hire a private driver to drive you everywhere. The car would be nicer and the driving would be better.

For real though, your scenario costs $16/day more. That's nearly $4,000 more per year on your commute. Most people don't have $4,000 to blow just on getting to/from work a little faster."
"1589","Wow can't wait for r/washingtonDC to tell me why everything is bad and wrong about public transportation! Surely they won't whine about poor people and talk about how great Uber is!"
"1590","What are you talking about? Anytime someone comes here to say something to the effect that cars are better than transit they get downvoted."
"1591","The answers to both those questions could be determined using statistics, I'd recommend brushing up on it. For both questions, using sampling methods, you could get a better idea about true population size. You could run some experiments, gather data, make a few assumptions, and get an estimate with a 95% confidence interval, for example."
"1592","As a data analyst interested in data science, my research has led me to believe that statistics is the number one skill a data scientist can posses. How accurate is that and if it's indeed accurate, aren't people looking to break into data science probably best served by taking an advanced degree (masters or phd, assuming they interested in forking out the cash for an advanced degree) in statistics vs an equivalent degree in data science or some similar tract?"
"1593","It depends. The contents of traditional stats program vary; adding the even wider variation of ""data science"", it's hard to say if a stats program prepares one better.

Traditional stats program spends enormous amount of time on things that are...not useful. It tends to lack reliable sources to learning programming best practices (how many people writes functions in R?). Most projects are done using toy datasets that work out too nicely for their intended purposes.

I would argue that it's unlikely that either program prepares one to be a data scientist. I'm pretty sure everyone ends up spending tons of time learning and doing side projects on their own.

If anything, a traditional stats program let you do something like when marketing guy says his regression model has R\^2 of .95 therefore the marking effort was incredible, you frown because he didn't check residuals (but of course you don't say anything and just let meeting continues).

"1596","When I first picked up a guitar, my fingers wouldn't hit the right notes and they would hurt from pushing on the strings. I didn't know what a chord was, I didn't know any songs. 15 years later I can close my eyes and play a collection of tunes with a soft touch so my fingers feel great.

It takes time to learn how to do things. Your attention and perseverance is what it takes, and you'll for sure learn eventually if you have those things."
"1597","I know, but I reserve the right to waste time griping about getting the chance to learn things I'm fascinated by and do things I love. It's the only way I can maintain my brand.  


Thank you for the words of actual wisdom, joking aside."
"1598","That's what learning feels like in the early stages.

But over time the coding starts to feel natural.

"1600","Here's some of the best advice I know about how to prepare for interviews:

https://80000hours.org/career-guide/how-to-get-a-job/#how-to-prepare-for-interviews

1. ""When you meet an employer, ask lots of questions to understand their challenges.""
2. ""Prepare your three key selling points ahead of meetings.""
3. ""Focus on whats most impressive.""
4. ""Prepare concrete facts and stories to back up your three key messages.""
5. ""Work out how to sum up what you have to offer in a sentence.""
6. ""Prepare answers to the most likely questions.""
7. ""Practice the meeting, from start to finish.""
8. ""Learn. After each interview, jot down what went well, what could have gone better, and what youll do differently next time."""
"1601","can relate. I'm not one to quickly regurgitate some stock answer in an interview.

I don't feel I interview well but maybe that is my perception as I've certainly worked at some major companies.

Thankfully my references explain how I am and I haven't had to interview in years."
"1602","This is one of those cases where the username doesn't check out."
"1603","If you have a master's degree in data science, or Kaggle projects, or if you've worked through a reading list, or taken online courses in data science -- those things are good! But seek out real experience as early and extensively as possible."
"1604","Yeah I have a masters in stats, havent done any MANOVAs or the like at all. Kinda want to go do refresher projects on those now lol"
"1605","Im currently applying to internships that I can work at while Im doing my masters which starts this fall. Would you count that as real world experience or do you strictly mean professional full-time work?"
"1606","Internships count as ""real-world"" experience."
"1607","Just to be a bit snarky, Entry level position, need at least 3 years of experience."
"1608","I think you should apply your statistical reasoning to this issue rather than this emotional response."
"1609","Ok :)"
"1610","It's easy to say work at a company with data before, or get a research assistant under a professor., But the ground reality is different.
Most of times, without experience it is difficult to be able to get to work at a company, it's a never ending of loop of companies wanting experience vs us not having one and looking for the same. 
And professors don't respond, I have sent out countless mails to professors, asking to volunteer, but none replied. At this stage even if I genuinely want to get real world experience, I can't do anything. 
As I said it feels like a   never ending loop, with nobody ready to offer you the chance."
"1611","I'm in the same boat, but I think that's where the ""collected and analysed data for fun"" bit comes in. You can count it as real experience."
"1612","Can you post an example of the kind of email you sent to professors? If you like, I can give some feedback."
"1613","I will dm you, if that's fine"
"1614","Ok feel free to dm me."
"1615","The more you are familar with real life experience, the better you are.

Real life problems are not perfectly cleaned data from university/Kaggle. It requires hard work, policies, privacy concerns... to get to the desire ouput before actual DS work. Therefore unless you are in a really professional team, you would end up involved in data collection part anyway.

Also proper domain knowledge are better than Machine Learning most of the time, which is hard to swallow for fresh out of college new comers."
"1616","Another thing to consider is that knowing the ""messiness"" of the data can really help in modelling it with correct assumptions."
"1617","Certainly real experience is important and I understand prospective data scientists often overemphasize textbook type knowledge. However, the two categories you laid out seem arbitrary. I don't know how you can say working with data as part of a research project is good experience and a masters degree isn't."
"1618","Yeah the knowledge in a masters degree is more theoretical. But aren't the people in your first category better suited for an entry level job? While the other group, depending on the experience, would get a regular job. Because it sounds you would dismiss the first category completely as potential candidates.
It all depends on the company and the job offering, I know."
"1619","We definitely wouldn't dismiss the master's degree students as potential candidates. But the best potential candidates have worked on data projects for fun and they've usually tried to seek out real-world data projects."
"1620","Kaggle projects ARE for fun though. And its real world data. Your points are in conflict with one another...."
"1621","It's not what I would call ""real world data"" because the data they use never has the TRULY BIZARRE crap that we run across all the time in industry. An awful lot of data science is basically janitorial work - hooking up the pipes, making sure everything is clean, and checking it out if something smells weird. It's gotten to the point where ""data custodian"" or ""data janitor"" roles sometimes exist in teams just to make sure that the data getting to the analysts, data scientists, and machine learning engineers is even a tenth as clean as Kaggle data."
"1622","Thats still an entirely separate problem than the statistical learning of data, which means Kaggle is STILL experience. This tells me you dont write off the data from Kaggle, rather you need more experience in the ETL pipeline of how to get data and transform it into a usable form. Then you already have the experience in taking usable data and gaining insights from it."
"1623","Sure. Can you agree that this still doesn't make it ""experience with real-world data"" though? The points OP is making aren't in conflict.   


Also, I think it's important to understand that there's a lot more that happens in cleaning data than ETL and transformation in industry. It's certainly important, but I come across data sources regularly that don't have a data dictionary, haven't ever had any profiling done on them, represent data from three different phases of business logic with no rhyme or reason explaining the differences, etc. It's a lot of slow, careful, detailed analysis, combined with straight-up detective work, and fixing other peoples' well-intentioned mistakes."
"1624","Totally agree with you on that point. Best way to learn is to get your hands dirty. Most data you'll get in a masters or by kaggle etc. will be pre cleaned to fit the lesson."
"1625","Disagree with the assumption that ""most data you'll get in a master's course will be pre cleaned to fit the lesson"".  I pulled data from 12 different real-world sources for my MS Econ masters project (and I know that others in my cohort pulled real-world data too, as our projects were econometric by nature).  I'd be surprised to learn my school was the exception to masters projects/theses (correct me if I should be, though)."
"1626","Probably because you were studying economics. I'd bet that on pure math or CS focused courses you wouldn't have that experience."
"1627","I agree. I have an econ background and have interviewed tons of people, and it seems like it's common for econ students to get a lot of hands-on experience with data through RA jobs, replication exercises, or writing papers for classes, while CS students typically don't. 

Meanwhile, the DS/ML Master's students I've talked to seem to have taken a zillion classes and covered a huge amount of ground within a year and a half, but their understanding is shallow and they forget most of what they've learned by the time they show up to the interview."
"1628","That's really good. Maybe there's a switch currently, cause I had some experiences as described above. But if there's more practical work with real world data in masters you'll be better prepared for industry work.
But it all depends on the masters curriculum and the university as a whole."
"1629","Question: What if you worked with data in a company but it doesnt align with the work that you are interested in? Im currently developing ETL processes and cleaning data and although I understand how critical this is in the data science workflow, I want to better utilize my quantitative skills to help build models and interpret results.

Im currently writing towards a masters degree on a part time basis to update my mathematical skills and recently started freelancing where I can utilize my research, math and coding skills to produce a deliverable for my client. Is this the right direction?

Thanks!"
"1630","How large (approximately) is the company you currently work at?

Often you can move into a more ""data science""-y role by working at a smaller company (e.g. 10-50 employees) where the needs for a ""data person"" are more diverse and less specialised into particular roles. If you have experience working with real data and you can show some modelling skills, that could be a promising direction -- you could *potentially* move directly into a ""Data Scientist"" role."
"1631","Can I ask you a question about how to ""sell"" myself? I'm preparing to leave academia after a PhD in experimental psychology + 3 years postdoc research. My problem is that people hear ""psychology"" and don't necessarily think ""data"".  

My job involves quite a lot of experimental design, big datasets, all kinds of scripting (python, mostly), coding of experimental programs using C# and taking care of our AWS environment that hosts everything. And of course lots of reports and presentations, which might be useful as well.  
My side projects mostly deal with web scraping and social listening to gather and analyse some massive datasets using NLP (definitely some messy data in there).  
So I think I'd have some experience but I might not get to the point to explain it if I'm labeled ""psychologist"".

Any tips you can give or insight into how someone with my background would be perceived?"
"1632","It sounds like you have a strong background, and it's interesting - it would provide a lot of experience for you to talk about in interviews.

As you realise, how you brand yourself does matter. While I don't really like Ramit Sethi's tone, his ""How to Write a Winning Resume"" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0fjkKCsM1w] is very helpful for thinking about this.

The key thing is to work out your own narrative to explain: ""I studied xyz, I found it fascinating, I decided to do a PhD in AbC. I found working with data was really interesting but I wanted to pursue this in industry rather than academia because it had more hands-on immediate results"" or whatever is true in your case. Also check out https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/data-science/ which might be helpful, and https://mode.com/blog/data-scientists-making-the-leap-academia-to-industry."
"1633","That's some really helpful stuff - thank you! And good point on the narrative, definitely some good advice for me to work on."
"1634","You're welcome! Let us know how you go. :)"
"1635","I can't tell you anything on the hard skills but I can give you a general industry perspective. You've got an outside view - which /can/ be a good thing. I'd shift the focus more onto the skills and work experience and less onto your field of study, though.

Highlight your projects, your work processes and your collaborations.
Fundamentally, companies need to make money, so you have to show that you can work productively in their environment and help them reach their goals. Try to show the interviewers how the skills - which you have - can address the company's problems - which you need to find out.

Depending on how the interview process works ask them questions about typical problems that you'd encounter in the job and draw paralleles to how you solved similar problems in the past. 
This will give them an idea on how you approach new situations.

By the by, a PhD is not only quasi work experience but also your first major project management experience. 3+ years with setbacks, problems, adapting your methods, reevaluating your goals, showing perseverance and a willingness for hard work. How you deal with all these setbacks is equally important to the results.
Bonus points if you did grant proposals, worked with large budgets, taught students etc. etc... :)

Also, make sure your cover letter and CV reflect that (dpends a bit in your country, too). Scientific and industrials CVs are very different  and this might make the difference of being invited to the interview."
"1636","You may want to consider HR analytics (people analytics).  There is a huge behavioral/psychology component to this field, and finding people in industry  with that expertise who can also wrangle data and code is difficult. Its maybe not as sexy as other DS fields but its pretty interesting."
"1637","I was just about to post this. I work in people analytics and I really enjoy it. More and more HR departments are starting to see the value of having a data scientist in the department, especially if said scientist comes from a background in psychology or economics (with a heavy statistical focus of course). Also, soft skills matter quite a bit, and I agree, it's tricky to find data scientists who have some combination of all of these factors. I expect the demand for these roles to increase quite a bit over the next few years."
"1638","This is a great suggestion!"
"1639","I have kind of a similar background and have established myself in a career focused on a/b testing / experimentation at scale. Id suggest reframing your background from psychology to experimental psychology since people in other fields dont necessarily know how quantitative psychology can be. You might also consider looking into data science roles that focus more on inference and less on ML. Theres a real need for people who can advise on experimental methods and unlike ML its not necessarily an area where software engineers can fill the gap"
"1640","Have an acquaintance that was accepted to Hulu with your kind of background. Might want to try companies like that."
"1641","Ngl y'all have a doe background that would get you into engineering.

So frustrating to see employment numbers for experimentals"
"1642","I have a similar issue. Background in nursing and Masters in Public Health, 3-5 years ""working with data"", but I never really feel qualified for postings."
"1643","I work in a startup, and your post makes a whole lot of sense to me just from what I've seen.

Almost none of the work I do is clean cut implementation of cutting edge ML models. The vast majority is solving problems related to data storage, collection, manipulation and enrichment. Our deep learning networks are pretty basic in the grand scheme of things and I'd expect anyone with even a basic understanding of ML to be able to understand and replicate them. 

Instead, what I find most useful is working very closely with my other founders, and leveraging their domain expertise to understand what exactly the features and structure of our models should be, and working to design our data collection applications accordingly.

Admittedly, this is a small company with very different challenges to major organisation, but unquestionably I'd agree that the skills I need at this stage are less on the theoretical and more on the practical 'hands dirty' kind of experience you mentioned."
"1644","Thanks for your perspective. :)"
"1645","Ive had interviewers want the opposite from me. I have experience at my Uni in two different fields as a data scientist: pharmaceuticals, retail. 

I didnt have enough real world experience because it was still attached through the university. 

Youre right to seek real projects, but university and research positions didnt help me with a job in industry. 

What did help me: my personal website with a portfolio and rundown of: tutorials, personal projects, tools Ive developed. This shows I love what I do, and can take the time communicate it."
"1646","I actually am finishing up soon both a BME AND Biostats MS and I still dont feel qualified enough.

My statistical analysis skills are strong but my programming/CS skills are pretty week despite having been in engineering too (BE undergrad didnt teach us that well and neither did grad in both fields)I am able to do classical and semi classical statistics like GLMs/Mixed models (probably what I am best at), ridge/lasso, PCA, discriminant analysis. I am most comfortable with R and only know very little Python. I have no experience with genomics and high dim data analysis. 

Also know absolute 0 about know classes/structs, databases, APIs, RShiny, or production. No knowledge about making code faster or algorithms. 

But I sure as hell can come up with p values (that rhe data sci real world doesnt care about). My next assignment is using 300+ variables as predictors to try to predict Alzheimers diagnoses on around 700 patients. Still p&lt;n. Probably will be making use of glmnet() or PCA. 

My program also doesnt teach modern things like NNs/deep learning etc. Its a heavily classical oriented thing. How can a classically trained biostatistician get into data sci if CS skills are weak?"
"1647","Hmm. What kind of data science roles are you interested in?"
"1648","Stuff like Biomedical Data Scientist.

I dont mind statistician jobs too but I am trying to broaden my search"
"1649","My guess is that you have a lot of valuable skills.

If you're interested in becoming a Biomedical Data Scientist, the key thing I'd suggest is getting experience working on a project with a researcher in biomedicine -- have you considered that?"
"1650","Yes I have done research in BME. Even recently published a paper. However, it has been entirely classical statistics with some semi classical stuff here and there. 

I help labmates analyze their wet lab datasets, which are generally small datasets. That is where I got experience with the typical classical models like GLMs, GLMMs as well as tools such as Bootstrap. Some ggplot2 plotting as well and Monte Carlo simulations. 

Then in Biostats I am working with someone on looking at MRI data *however* all the preprocessing and so on is done and I dont even see the image. We dont deal with the actual image and we just deal with measures derived from it. Its entirely mostly classical longitudinal analysis. 

That stuff isnt exactly sexy in todays data science climate. Many data scientists dont even know this stuff at all but it doesnt matter. 

My next part though I requested that PI to give me something more modern, but it is essentially going to still be semi-classical prediction using basic ML with a large number of predictors (already derived from the image) to predict AD risk. 

For data science I often see things like web scraping, knowing APIs, cloud computing, interfacing models with medical devices (production), big data, databases and so on. I know none of that, only the statistical aspects and in R. 

Its unfortunate but I dont think recruiters appreciate classically trained statisticians. We arent exactly known for being good programmers. 

I still struggle a lot with basic Python. It doesnt make sense to me as I am not good with OOP but R I am fine"
"1651","In data science no-one is going to know everything, so I wouldn't worry about not knowing about web scraping, APIs, etc. too much. Data science roles are diverse, and in any role you'll need to learn new skills, and many of your existing skills will be very useful for you.

There's a difference as well between more ""science""-oriented roles vs. more ""engineering""-oriented roles in data science. Your skills are more aligned towards the first category than the second, but you could invest some time into learning software engineering practices.

If you want to go into biomedical data science, the key thing will be finding positions -- e.g. in biomedical companies or (possibly) academic contexts. The earlier you can seek out those positions and speak to people at those companies / institutions to get their advice, and to get a sense of what positions are available, the better."
"1652","Yea its funny, I actuallt have the BME engineering degree but I was always better at the science (as in chem/physics etc) and data analysis stats type things. I was never good with building things or in this case production level code stuff.

I think I really need industry experience. Never had an internship unfortunately and first job is notoriously difficult to get. I have had phone interviews but nothing more yet. Some positions also seem like phantom positions and dont actuallt exist but the recruiters are seeing what is out there...The job world equivalent of Tinder girls seeking validation etc"
"1653","I feel like 1 and 2 aren't mutually exclusive. I am currently a masters in business analytics student and landed a full time data science type role. My background when I interviewed and accepted the offer was 1 year of experience in my masters, and some simple excel stuff in my previous role. What I did during my studies helped prepare me for the job though. For example, one of the projects I worked on for a machine learning course happened to use a very messy dataset from kaggle, involving something I was interested in from a personal perspective. Judging by your segmentation, I would fall into the ill-prepared category, however every performance review I've had since starting at my new role has been stellar. I also have not had an internship and have not worked as a research assistant during my degree.

So, my advice to you would be to loosen the reigns a bit and don't enter into interviews with these candidates with such a shrewd eye. You may be surprised."
"1654","Interesting. Can you talk more about the dataset you were interested in from a personal perspective? (No need to go into details if you are not comfortable doing that here)

Also -- did you have previous work experience?"
"1655","Sure, np. The dataset is from open powerlifting. It contains meet results for various powerlifting competitions dating back to 1970. Some of the competitions were for bench, squat and deadlift, while others were only bench, or squat and deadlift.  There was data for men and women, and age groups for kids through seniors. Country, lifting federation, drug testing results. Essentially all of the stats you would expect for a powerlifting competition. There is significant missing data, and in general it's what would be considered a narrow dataset and required a lot of feature engineering before any kind of analysis could be performed. There was ample opportunity to flex my skills in EDA and build some visualizations, looking at some of the time series elements as well how the data is clustered and distributed. Overall, it was really fun and my main takeaway was that the one thing I enjoy more than anything in the world of data is building compelling visualizations.

I had about 10 years of work experience prior to starting the program, but ina field completely unrelated to data and analytics."
"1656","Fascinating. Glad it's going well!"
"1657","Id also add any engineering background is a massive tick. If you know how to do something useful with data and can sensibly engineer something so it is actually usable, Id hire you in a heart beat.

Typically these people have experience using a language on the JVM (or a lower level language)"
"1658","Software engineering skills are definitely valuable, if combined with experience working with data."
"1659","A little off-topic here, but having hired for DS roles, and considering  your points above, I'm curious to know what you'd make of my situation.  I've been applying for (non-senior) DS jobs for 3-4 months now.  I have have detailed on my resume experience with both of your points (the things that I think make me good, and the things that actually do make me good), and yet, after 140+ applications, I've only had one interview (no other contact from potential employers).  I have an MS in econometrics and worked quite a bit with real-world data.  Additionally, I completed a highly competitive and intense post-graduate data science fellowship (top 5% of applicants accepted, required 65 hr. work weeks for the 3 months of the fellowship).  Any advice on better marketing myself (given the limited information you have, of course)?"
"1660","It's tricky to give advice without knowing, e.g., where you live; where you are applying for roles; whether you are applying for advertised roles or not; what your cover letters / emails are like; and what your CV is like (in presentation as well as content).

It sounds like you have a strong background. Marketing yourself does matter. While I don't really like Ramit Sethi's tone, his ""How to Write a Winning Resume"" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0fjkKCsM1w] is very helpful for thinking about this.

The key thing is to work out your own narrative to explain: ""I studied xyz, I found it fascinating, I decided to do a PhD in AbC.

Also check out https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/data-science/ which might be helpful, and https://mode.com/blog/data-scientists-making-the-leap-academia-to-industry.

Also, if you have submitted 140+ applications, and only had one interview, you need to re-assess how you are approaching the application process. It sounds like you have a strong skillset. Finding data science roles calls for a combination of (1) time invested, (2) the right technique/approach, and (3) showing you have the necessary experience and skills.

I was able to get a lot of meetings with people from different data companies by sending emails like this:

----
Hi &lt;First name&gt;,

My name is ... 
I'm ... (a sentence about my experience).

Are you looking to hire a data scientist in the next couple of months?
If so, can we meet up and talk about it?

Thanks,

I didn't attach my CV unless I was asked for it. I emailed dozens of companies and got many interviews."
"1661","Are these emails sent to people in DS roles at the company or HR people? And, how would one go about finding emails of specific people? Ive tried using LinkedIn InMail to recruiters at companies of interest, but not much luck. Email is definitely more direct but Im not sure how one would get that info."
"1662","Id like to hear /u/tl_throws view on this question too. Im guessing we may have more luck going to hiring managers rather than HR people."
"1663","It depends on the size of the company.

My approach here is likely to work better for smaller companies (&lt; 150 employees).

I'd suggest directly emailing the lead data scientist / head of the data team / head of the product team, or even the CTO / CEO of smaller tech companies -- usually you can find emails for these people on the company websites."
"1664","If you are not getting interviews after that many applications and you're applying to posted jobs, you are probably getting frequently screened by HR automated systems. DS is very trendy and gets lots of people will apply for every opening, so places are either using automated screening, or their manual screening is so fast as to be as dumb as an automated system.

You need to make sure your resume contains all the keywords someone might screen for, and you need to make sure it's text searchable."
"1665","Thats helpful. Been doing my best to match terminology in my resume (so far as to, at times, copy &amp; paste the exact phrases from the job posting). Guess Ill have to become even more particular in how I write my resume?"
"1666","Love this post, because I forgot about point 2 as advice for people. Went to an analyst meetup  a couple years ago and announced I was learning python for data science. A retail research company immediately hit me up for a small project.

I got to learn the important things about working on real data projects:

* MESSY survey data from multiple PDFs
* Splotchy responsiveness and communication with stakeholders
* Learning their language, culture, &amp; 'truths' to figure out how to present results
* How to pronounce Paducah, Kentucky

Bottom line is get your hands on some real data if possible. Best case scenario is you can do this within your company and prove out some results. Other cases are that you either have to network locally or reach out to people to get on some projects."
"1667","Amazing!"
"1668","really well said. as a data scientist who has managed teams of ds's and interviewed/trained new hires, this is 100% what i look for as well"
"1669","I briefly studied data science at the graduate level. Most people didn't like coding. Even those who said they liked coding weren't coding. Personally I like coding and that's why I was the first to get poached and got hired in one of the world's largest banks after 3 courses.

I have ***one*** advice: fire up that IDE and code"
"1670","Coding is so important!"
"1671","Thanks - good to hear an Australian perspective.

Im doing a combo, studying through edX for UCSanDiego and working through accessing and analysing open data available through state government open data portals 

I get little bits and pieces in the BI team at work, but I have to stay on top of my day job in QA."
"1672","That's interesting. How do you find the experience of doing both? Do they complement each other well? It sounds like you're doing both at once."
"1673","Im using what Im learning in the course to work on the data, jumping around a bit since we havent covered APIs yet. They do complement each other, and the variety means I dont get bored.

Im also doing it to build a portfolio, and hitting datasets for government departments Id like to work for.  The aim is to make up for a lack of workplace experience, with some decent demos of my ability. Plus to demonstrate interest."
"1674","That sounds good - although I imagine it can be a bit exhausting!

Many public APIs are quite well-documented so you could probably dive into them right away."
"1675","Having just spent the last 3 years transitioning from Session Musician into Data Scientist and taking a decent number of interviews, in the end this advice is close enough to the reality that got me over the line.

The thing that I think may be overlooked is how trivial the real world examples even need to be to do their part, when supported by a couple of more recent achievements (in my case for this I took HDip in Data Science when I decided to make the switch, as well as creating a domain specific open source project:
https://github.com/OscarSouth/theHarmonicAlgorithm).

Real world examples included:

1. Managing a paper database for a hospital as a summer job at 18y. This example also made for some good moments of humour!

2. Querying an Oracle database with ready made SQL queries as part of a temp role as an assistant at a QC lab.

3. Conversations and poking around with toy datasets from friends/family who are professionals in other fields that would like to know what more they can do with their companies data.

Most importantly though (I feel) was how I used these examples in the language of the interviews domain area in response to questions and scenarios thrown at me by the interviewers. Hand in hand with being able to deliver this performance was finding a good fit with people/business  it took a dozen or so interviews to find the right match.

I start on Monday! Im looking forward to it!"
"1676","OPs point: what makes you good at a job is real experience at the job.

No shit. This is a terrible take though. If you dont have a job in DS or any actual classroom experience then youre saying all that other shit is irrelevant.

I have a Masters degree, Kaggle work, and taken online courses and I have a Data Engineer job offer on the table right now. You know what makes good experience? Experience."
"1677","I broke into data science mostly through hobby projects, and by following this career path:

Chemistry PhD &gt; Bioinformatician &gt; Data Engineer &gt; Data Scientist 

It took 2.5 years after my PhD, but I've finally made it."
"1678","Good job! 

It's hard out there, especially for chemists."
"1679","So,

to uneducated swines trying to get a job: you have to have this job to get a job!!!

to superior intellectuals who already have a job in the same field in the same exact industry and want to break into industry(??): you're doing fine!

sincerely,

every company and hr in this world

(btw, if you worked with data at your job they'll tell ""but well your data was different type of data, and their data at their specific industry is different so gtfo"").

Thanks for useless advice!"
"1680","Has this happened to you?"
"1681","yes it did.

I don't understand how this advice makes sense, honestly. I mean yes, it sounds logical, you have more chances to get a job if you have experience. Hiring though isn't even close to anything logical neither it's some kind of exact sceince. All this advice alike ""find problems, then find solutions, then work for free for someone"" just fucks up whole industry and sets further this already absolutely retarded process.

But what does that imply, is that you have to waste more time and energy when you already have qualifications(that's literally what you get diploma for), knowledge and skills, just to get a **chance** at being considered. Then it won't matter 95% of time anyway, because of random BS  most won't even look at your github, will skim through your resume for 3 seconds and throw it in the trash.

Then we get further and further down ""oh no diploma won't cut it, then no, personal projects won't cut it, then no, actually getting paid for work won't cut it'. Fuck this bullshit. You know what ""finding problems and developing solutions"" means? It's called making own business.

Best chance at getting hired is pesonally knowing people in the industry who can get you hired, to skip you through the bullshit of ""you're from wrong industry/have wrong type of diploma/live too far away/don't work with this exact stack we have at company/ don't have experience with real life business problems/ wear wrong pants/ have wrong age"".

If doing all that actually made any difference that would be great, but in actuality it increases your chance by like 1/10 while setting you up for miserable grind and burn out. For every one problem your business is trying to solve there's 100 different businesses who will scoff at your projects because they have different kind of problems, and yours are 'not real world enough' for them. 

Personal projects are cool, trying to sew your whole life around someone's stupid business to maybe get a chance to get hired is stupid, and that's what we're moving too with those posts."
"1682","It sounds like you've had a really hard time trying to break in to this industry. If it's any consolation, data science isn't the only industry where this is happening. I have friends who graduated with degrees from BAs to Ph.Ds, in fields from humanities to biochemistry, and they all hit the same ""gotta have experience to get experience"" wall.

Have you thought about being a consultant? A number of consultancies hire based on cultural fit and potential, and provide direct mentoring."
"1683","I thankfully didn't get all my energy to get into that field, partly because I noticed that in data science advice like this thread is the norm and competition is insane. I just switched to searching different kind of jobs in IT.

I'm mostly speaking from my experience trying to switch fields before and from all people I know. I don't know a single successful person who went balls deep into some field before actually getting paid for it. And all most successful people I know have general skills and rely on just being liked as a person and can learn stuff quickly when someone's ready to pay for it, and don't sell themselves short.

Last interview I went for I actually didn't apply for myself, I was contacted by their HR and it was business analytics position(my resume just says python programmer). They needed python, finance &amp; statistics knowledge, economic background, UX skills and bunch of other random shit I somehow know. So I, having economics degree and work experience, several UX projects on behance, programing projects on github, some experience with working with data in python on my current job, went there.

And most of the interview guy was rambling about how their sector HoReCa is very different to everything else, and especially having no background in sales company(mine is healthcare) I'm probably not a good fit to work there. They had shitton of very diverse qualification requirements and yet even fitting 90% of them they still thought I'm not good fit because I'm not working in some ultra specialized industry lol. And it's the interview I was invited too by them.

It's just waste of energy and time, shotgun approach and networking all yield much better results in finding any kind of job."
"1684","While I don't really like Ramit Sethi's tone, his ""How to Write a Winning Resume"" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0fjkKCsM1w] is very helpful for thinking about how you brand yourself. The key thing is to work out your own narrative to explain: ""I studied xyz, I found it fascinating, I decided to do a PhD in AbC. I found working with data was really interesting but I wanted to pursue this in industry rather than academia because it had more hands-on immediate results"" or whatever is true in your case. Also check out https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/data-science/ which might be helpful, and https://mode.com/blog/data-scientists-making-the-leap-academia-to-industry.

&gt; when you already have qualifications(that's literally what you get diploma for)

""Real-world"" experience is easier and less expensive and more likely to help someone get a role in data science compared to a qualification e.g. an online course or master's degree in data science."
"1685","Whiny post is whiny...

&gt;  when you already have qualifications(that's literally what you get diploma for)

A diploma doesn't mean you 'have the qualifications' its simply a certificate that you have a base level of technical competency in the field. As someone who has a Masters in DS I can tell you that although it has some benfits, topics are covered at such a high level and largely theoretical that it doesn't really translate into real world application

But more importantly, you have to to understand how data science emerged as a field in order to understand why a degree doesn't hold the same weight in industry any more. 

Most people who blazed the 'data scientist' trail were never intending to be data scientists because it didnt exist. Sure most of the time they pick up some useful skills either in their major or by themselves (stats, coding, etc..). They end up in a completely unrelated job role. They then had the idea that 'hey this job could be done better, let me see if I can apply some of this random coding or statistics I picked up"". And they do, and they apply it successfully. 

Next thing you know, you have someone revolutionizing the way that a process has been done by using data, statistics, and coding. This is incredibly valuable to a company, and despite what people think, companies (if successful) will lift up this kind of step change in success. Next thing you know that person is learning more, getting better, applying more complex techniques and reaping even larger awards from the company. And boom. Thats how you got this 'sexiest job of 20XX' and 'highest paid jobs' etc...

It has nothing to do with being able to explain SGD or predicting housing prices with accuracy in kaggle. It has everything to do with increasing the profit for a company bottom line. 

So when people complain about 'well I just graduated my program X and I cant find work as a data scientist' its because those lucrative jobs - which require experience and real world understanding - are being filled by people who worked their way there and are bringing massive $$$ to the company (its easy to justify a good salary when you have projects saving the company millions year over year). 

If you want an off the shelf job with your off the shelf degree. Then you start as a data analyst (which in many companies is the fresh out of college position in the data scientist family) and you work your way up. Alternatively you can spend your time figuring out how to apply data to whatever field you currently are in your free time to show your value.

&gt; If doing all that actually made any difference that would be great, but in actuality it increases your chance by like 1/10 while setting you up for miserable grind and burn out. For every one problem your business is trying to solve there's 100 different businesses who will scoff at your projects because they have different kind of problems, and yours are 'not real world enough' for them.

What a load of BS. Sounds like you're just not good at interviewing. The point isn't that your project is identical between company A and company B. EVERY company has different problems, data, processes, goals, etc... Hiring managers understand that. The goal in your interview isnt to say I did this and therefore I can do it here. Its to say: I had this problem, this is why I thought it needed to be solved, I considered things like a b and c, and then went with solution d. It was successful and I was able to change the way we did x. In hindsight I would have done y and in the future I may do z.

There is a reason so many companies place so much focus on the STAR method. It shows your thinking not necessarily your technique. And that, at the end of the day, is what makes valuable people valuable, not what they covered in their CS311 course."

Is there a recomendation you can give me, since you are a profesional in the subjet and I am just a guy who want to learn by doing thinks in my work, but also contribute to develope our full potential (or at least make thinks better).

Find ways to collect, clean, and visualise the data -- I highly recommend https://r4ds.had.co.nz/ (R For Data Science) and David Robinson's ""Tidy Tuesdays"" videos [https://www.youtube.com/user/safe4democracy/videos] where he shows you how he does data analyses.

Realise too that sometimes there are big process changes which you can make to improve processes without necessarily needing to collect and analyse a lot of data.

I'm self taught. Started with excel, then moved into access, and am OK at basic to intermediate SQL. I work with Tableau and Power BI and am picking up the scripting side of things there. I am working through codeacademy's data science career path (SQL, python, machine learning) and a tableau certification (need for work).   


I spend most of my time at work uploading csv reports from multiple departments to access, cleaning the data through SQL and my (extremely) rudimentary understanding of VBA. I work primarily with 4-5 tables ranging from employee data, to parking lot occupancy. A few tables are upwards of 16 million rows that I have to run analyses on and create visuals for slide decks and one-pagers for my boss. 

Formal schooling and I do not get along well, so going back for a DS or similar degree is out for me.

"1705","Can you automate things? If you can do that, and save a lot of time, that's really valuable experience and it will look good on your CV.

However, beware the trap of getting too focused on the data at the expense of losing sight of what the data is telling you about. Data is just a tool to understand the world.

You also need to consider realistically whether anyone is going to change things based on the analysis you do / recommendations you provide. Sometimes processes or designs are so entrenched that you can't do much to change them, especially if you are an intern and you are there for a short span of time.

Are there areas of data science you're interested in long-term?"
"1706","Yeah, I've looked for opportunities for that but I haven't come across any yet.

I can make a very simple data network, where one data sheet can talk to an other data sheet, update in real time, for a more productive workflow.

But as far as automating machines and things like that, no.  That's because with Heat Treat, it is 99% Manual Labor.  The thing I do best, however, is having people skills.  I'm not the type of person to just type in data into an Excel file and not understand what the numbers mean.

If the numbers don't make sense, I'll go on the shop floor, talk to one of the guys running the operation and get the back story on what happened that day and why this tolerance was over tolerance all in a friendly and helpful manner.

I've solved long lasting problems during my internship that way (I am talking about issues that have reoccurring for atleast 5 years) just by simply walking upto the Operator and ask questions.  Stuff like doing IT work for the operator because his desktop on his workbench is down, to simple things like teaching them how to send an email.  And that stuff is important because it's no secret that the older gentlemen are not as tech savvy as us young guys, it helps move action items further for an easier workflow.  In the most humbling way, I am the bridge that fills the gap between the shop floor and the engineering office.

I'm taking on bigger projects by helping the metal urgest, picking her brain on why certain operations are done for what reason, but like I said, so far the work is data entry with an Analysis on the side."

"1712","I have a specific definition of data scientist, which is those who develop new algorithms and means of accounting for signal and/or error in any type of model. A scientist creates new knowledge, so in my mind a data scientist creates new knowledge as it applies to data analysis methods.

""An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R"" by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani - available free at http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/

""R for Data Science"" by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, available free online at https://r4ds.had.co.nz/"
"1721","Thanks for the suggestions. This thread has been interesting to read, including all your responses."
"1722","I think what OP is actually stating...is that there is no book or books to read that can just miraculously help you understand how to deal with messy data problems. It requires taking a wide variety of tools and techniques and applying them uniquely to each problem. Thats the critical thinking part that is not taught in schools or books."
"1723","Solution: Job hop.

Edit: Seriously it might explain why job-hopping occurs nowadays. A lot of people know their value in a technical aspect and recruiters can only really evaluate on these features. If I'm dependent on a blind manager to give me a raise, it may never happen despite the level of value you bring. I don't particularly enjoy garbaging about sports teams for the brownie points."
"1724","Actually, job hopping is mainly driven by a different phenomenon - and that is that modern HR organizations make it impossible for managers to keep their best direct reports' pay and title at the level they deserve. So even if you *are* developing the relationships you need to develop, odds are the longer you stay at a job, the more underpaid and undertitled you are. It's incredibly rare to see an overperformer get rewarded at the rate they would if they just hit the open market.

I've had 4 jobs in my career. My average raise (including two promotions) is probably about 4%. My average salary increase when switching roles has been over 20% every single time. 

Now, the reason that companies don't promote people as fast internally as they do when they switch jobs is that they know a lot of people give value to the equity they have built inside a company - aka, the relationships they have built. Even if they are not getting you promoted, the fact that you have built a brand, that people trust you, that you know who to ask to get things done, etc., is valuable to people, and companies exploit that.

Is it a solution to avoid having to build relationships? Yes, but I think there's a ceiling. And that ceiling is likely going to be management - where in order to be successful, you eventually need to have developed those relationships, and where recruiters will look to evaluate your soft skills the further up you go. That, and it is difficult to get hired into e.g., Director roles without having been promoted into or from a management role before.

For context: when you evaluate individual contributors, one of your big risks is that the person doesn't have the technical skills to do the job. When you hire managers, your biggest risk is that they can't work with others."
"1725","this advice will not be taken well by the introverts"
"1726","I am an introvert, and yes - this was a hard pill to swallow.

However, the best way I've hear it said in another episode of the same podcast (paraphrased):

""As a company, we don't pay you to be ""you"" - we pay you to be effective. And if ""effective"" means talking to your boss about their dog, or the Marketing Director about the Dodgers, then that is what you need to do""."
"1727","I worked at a company for a time where I was a very high value contributor. I delivered the data product for multiple deals worth 1 million+ and was directly involved in analysis and constructing arguments for regulators that saved the company's ass. I also was responsible for hiring and mentoring new team members though they did not report to me.

I was not the sales person or the person arguing in front of the regulatory bodies, however, I independently made all of their content as well as deliverables on very short notice often working overtime to get it done. I collaborated in many product planning and/or hand-off meetings and got along well with most people. We won every dispute and also made a ton of money--like \~10-20% more every year I was there.

I was not rewarded for this--my title and salary remained flat for two years while this was going on. Meanwhile the sales people and product managers were rewarded as if they were the people responsible. All I got was a ""we couldn't have done it without you"" and a few complements in front of the whole team.

Come to find out, our parent company seemed to refuse to promote engineers or data scientists at all. They treated us like a fixed cost--people that can be replaced. This was not the case for anyone on the sales, product management, or marketing teams. They were the golden children and were given VPs and directorships like candy as well as control over what we were allowed to work on on the data team.

All I was asking for at the time was a market-rate pay increase as well as for them to set my title at what it was, that being ""senior"". They refused, so I asked what I could do to make that a reality. They couldn't answer me, other than telling me they don't think we needed a ""senior data scientist"" for the business and that they thought I was compensated well.

I compiled a list of job descriptions from multiple other companies and pulled verified salary data from a variety of sources (for example H1B Visa applications) which proved them wrong. The role I had was a senior level role by industry standards and I was underpaid. They made a weak promise about revisiting it in a year only to fail to meet my expectations again, so I left.

Lo and behold not even 9 months after I left that place I was hired as a principal data scientist, which is one level of seniority above what I was asking for.

All that to say, sometimes you do work well with others, and also deliver big ROI on your skills, only to get shafted by management's stupid ideology about who is just a cog, and who should be in control.

The only thing I can think is that a lot of my work was ""head down"" by necessity, so I didn't have as much face time with others as I would have liked. However this wasn't my fault really as I had recommended more hires, or for us to slow down in some areas so I could focus on other things only to be denied every single time because of ""budget"" and ""revenue shortfall""--which wasn't exactly correct considering they had a massive profit margins.

It started feeling like the parent company was milking us for all we were worth to fund their expansion, yet nothing ever trickled down to us. We didn't get stock or extra cash rewards beyond our fixed cash bonus."
"1728","There are two answers that I would have to this post - the legitimate one, and the argumentative one:

Legitimate answer: yes, relationships are necessary, but not sufficient for promotions. The same is true of performance - it's a necessary, but not sufficient condition for promotions. Ultimately, the organization needs to perceive your value as ""worthy"", and if the organization is not prepared to do that - or not competent enough to do that - then nothing in this world will get your promoted. 

Argumentative answer: the reason you did not get promoted is because you failed to build relationships with the people who mattered - those whose perception of your role determined your likelihood of getting promoted. That is, in order to get yourself promoted, what you would have needed to do is influence your organization over time to understand the value of an experienced data scientist. Alternatively, you should have leveraged your relationships to have other people help evangelize the value that you brought to the company - you should have influenced those same people that were taking all the credit to share some of it with you when discussing outcomes with key people.

Why is it an argumentative answer? Because that takes years, and the right course of action is to take a new job, get paid more, and not have to spend a bucket of sweat teaching other people why you are valuable.

However, it is important to highlight that if your company incorrectly fails to value your role, someone along the way has failed in building and effectively leveraging their relationships."
"1729","I hear you on the argumentative answer. I've thought something similar. In fact I don't dispute the premise that relationships matter quite a lot--it seemed to be friends of upper managers that got all the promotions.

Unfortunately I got myself into a position where I had to be working long hours alone in order to meet the demands of the business. It wasn't really possible to loop other people in and still meet the deadlines. We had meetings and all that around deliverables and hand-offs, but figure I'd spend 30 hours a week with my head down in the problem.

I did make an effort to be in the office and socialize more but it was seriously hard balancing that, the work, and my family. Towards the end I had a surgery and it was like the nail in the coffin, people were upset I wasn't in the office more during recovery because they had a series of big company events to showcase this or that. I just couldn't meet their expectations at that time because my health wasn't good.

Part of that problem was management's fault in planning for the gradually increasing workload I fell into, however, I can't help but wonder what I could have done differently on my end. I used to hang out with a lot of these coworkers after hours for years like friends, but I also wasn't the life of the party.

I don't think my value to the CEO, CTO, etc. was in question given what they said to me, but they either didn't want me managing people or didn't seem to trust me to manage people even though I was mentoring them. I am not sure why. They never told me anything substantive when I asked for that feedback. I was asking for feedback all the time in order to figure it out and nothing came of it.

All in all, it's water under the bridge at this point. I do think my next area of focus for personal development needs to be on the relationship-side. I can see how our current executives use their relationships to get us funding, sales, etc."
"1730","I think you landed on a different problem - you became too good at being an individual contributor to be worth the pain to promote you.

That is, if they promoted you, they would have needed to replace you. And that is a pain in the ass. So why not just keep you doing what you're doing now forever?

Of course, if they do that, they can't justify to any C-level person that they should pay you more - if you get promoted, it should be to do a different job. 

Again, the solutions here are far from simple. Part of what you'd want to do is to start leveraging being the ""expert"" to buy yourself time. That is, stop saying ""yes"" to everything, and start standing your ground and saying ""yeah, that's not going to happen by tomorrow - we'll need to make some simplifications/sacrifices"", and start building the argument for why you need someone else to help support you in this work - someone who you can then mentor/develop and eventually manage.

But again, this goes back to the same issue - at the end of the day, to change an entire company's perspective of your role is damn near impossible. You can work your relationships, but if you're not high up enough, what you would be asked to do is build relationships with people that you are not going to naturally build relationships with. So even getting in the same room with them could be a year-long effort - let alone have a relationships with them.

I had a similar issue at my last job, and again, there wasn't going to be a route for me to address that, relationships be damned, unless I was willing to suck it up for years - and given how in-demand data science is... yeah, I'm going to pass on that."
"1731","Thanks for the advice, it's very helpful. Saying ""no"" is not my forte, one other thing to work on."
"1732","I would say it's not as much about saying ""no"" as it is about not saying ""yes"".

Can you do this by tomorrow?

Bad answer: ""yes"".

Best answer: ""given the timeline, I would suggest we eliminate this portion, and make some simplifying assumptions on this one. If we can simplify the ask, then we should be able to have a really good answer by tomorrow"".

That is, you don't outright say ""no"", you just offer an alternate yes. Mind you, the person asking may say ""no, we can't change anything, it needs to be exactly like this"". If that's the case, then you have a couple of options:

Buy yourself time: ""That is going to be really tight. We can give you something tomorrow, but I can't guarantee that we will have had time to really pressure test the results, so we may have some exposure there. If this is something that is critical, can we maybe deliver preliminary results by tomorrow, but have a final revised version for (insert later meeting when people will actually discuss it)?""

The shot across the bow: ""Ok Bob, I'm going to have to pull all the stops and get all hands on deck to get this done by tomorrow. That means we're going to have to let Janet know that her request is going to be delayed, and we'll have to push off the (insert meeting name) till next week. Let me validate that with my boss and we'll move with that"". Or if it's just you and this means you're going to be working till midnight to get it done, something like ""Ok Bob, I understand how important this is, so I will make sure that this gets done tonight. It will probably hit your inbox late - 1-2am, so please review it as soon as you receive it and give me any feedback you might have"".

I call that the shot across the bow because you're making it clear that this is not something that you can pull consistently - you are at the very least putting some guilt into their side. Not only that, you're setting the table for the next time - since you were able to ""move things around"" to ""make things happen"", if the same situation arises again and you say ""Bob, we do not have the resources to get this done by tomorrow"", then Bob will be endlessly more likely to believe it."
"1733","1. Domain knowledge
2. Experience
3. Awareness of model assumptions and limitations
4. Active effort to improve and learn
5. Contextual knowledge
6. Communication Skills
7. Strategic thinking
8. Technique and theory (can run more than, I don't know, two models / four lines of code and can actually articulate what things \*mean\*)
9. Paid attention in stats. 
10. Get enough sleep for god's sake

Take it with a grain of salt, but that seems ""right"" to me."
"1734","Thanks. That seems a pretty exhaustive list. What do you mean by contextual knowledge?"
"1735","Can they tell me what the business case for the stuff they're doing is, how that fits into a broader strategy, why it matters, etc? It overlaps with strategic thinking and communication skills and domain knowledge, certainly."
"1736","Hmm... That surely is a recurring theme in most answers. Seems actual coding skills count for a lot less in the field."
"1737","It's not so much that they don't count, I think, but that in a necessarily technical field, it's not too rare to find people who can write code...but it's rare to find people who can write code and do all of that other stuff well too. Granted, coding skill obviously isn't useless and in fact is something that we could all probably keep working on improving forever, but it's a baseline requirement for (much of) the work in the field.

The difference between a decent structural engineer and a great structural engineer is probably less whether they can build a bridge and more whether they can think very carefully about the project as a whole, how it might work with the resources they have, and whether there are pitfalls the textbooks didn't mention, or which the textbooks did mention but which most people forget. I think a lot of that mostly just comes with experience coupled with useful feedback and active work to improve."
"1738","Pump the breaks on that.  Coding skills are absolutely 100% super important.  I'd rather teach a data scientist finance than teach finance guy data science. There's so many data scientists that can't pass a basic coding interview."
"1739","Fair, but given the average coding interview, doesn't that mostly mean we need to do a better job teaching people how to reverse a linked list?"
"1740","Personally, I don't really care for typical coding interviews for data scientists because they test different skills than the job function I'm interviewing people for. For entry-level, what I'm looking for is someone who knows enough about coding/software engineering practices that they can slot into and interact with a dev team producing client-facing apps.

My ideal interview process involves a technical assessment where I provide a lot of data in a similar structure to what we work with and tell the candidate that we want to see clean, well-documented code (usually in notebook format) exploring some interesting aspect of the data. I don't care what they choose or if they make incorrect subject-matter assumptions because there's no way most candidates know the field. What I do care about is if they can justify the analytical steps they took and write their code in a way that I can easily read and understand what's going on. People can learn more advanced stuff like unit testing and code optimization on the job, but if every loop uses a 1-letter control variable and there are zero comments that aren't obviously copy-pasted from someone else's code, that's a big red flag."
"1741","Yea, there's definitely diminishing returns the further you go down the ""standard"" coding interview.  Generally it's useful to suss out an applicant's overall technical knowledge / exposure depending on the position.  Like, if you're a data scientist who claims to be an expert in python... well we'll find out quick."
"1742","I am profoundly worried whenever anyone describes themselves as an ""expert.""

Like, obviously arbitrary metrics are suspect, but my assumption is generally that anyone who has not actively developed their craft in a specific field with particular tools over, say, ten years is probably not an ""expert."" Unless they're one of the only people in that field;  3 years after Python started existing there were a few Python experts, of course. 

You're right that ability to write good code can't be taken for granted. For all the bootcamps and resources out there, we don't do a great job of developing consistently good, clean, efficient, well thought out, well tested code as a standard practice/competency. Though some of that may be that it seems there's less likely to be as much mentorship or code review or testing in the ""Data Space"" as there is in the ""This product desperately needs to run well"" space."
"1743","Well to be fair passing what is now considered a ""basic coding interview"" gives essentially 0 insight into the candidate's quality when it comes to doing any of the coding you do as a data scientist or even as a software engineer. 

It's just a measure of how much they grinded leetcode or a roll of a dice for if they've seen that specific question before."
"1744","Depends on the area, I work in geoscience, I absolutely would rather teach a geologist how to code than teach geology to a computer scientist."
"1745","That's fair."
"1746","Thats more than fair. Subject matter expertise is hugely valuable"
"1747","Definitely, imagine being passed a project with no comments and no organization in terms of classes and functions... would be a nightmare to pickup where they left off"
"1748","You asked for what makes an ""average"" DS vs a ""good"" DS. Being able to code in DS is pretty much a pre-requirement."
"1749","Imo this whole list can be summarized as ""curiosity."" And it's my opinion that this skill is the most important. It doesn't matter if your undergrad/experience is in theatrical dance, as long as you're curious (self-motivation implied) you can learn anything. 

That said, when it comes to #8 (tech &amp; theory) curiosity really is what will set a DS apart. 

\- Do you have the motivation to teach yourself DS&amp;A? Seriously, data cleaning tasks can be sped up greatly by DS&amp;A familiarity.

\- You're trying to learn gradient descent but never took a calculus course, do you have the curiosity to learn calc 1-3, then implement the gradients from scratch to better understand how they work?

\- You need to use PCA, but are willing to put the hours in to understand what eigenvectors/values actually represent?

\- You're given a task in an unfamiliar domain, let's say real estate, are you curious enough about the industry to learn the required domain knowledge?

It all comes down to how curious you are. If you're the type who's just chasing the hype train, you'll lose steam while the truly curious ones outrun you. If you stay curious and hungry for knowledge, you'll eclipse your peers with impressive degrees from prestigious institutions."
"1750","A summarized list would be useless. Curiosity is a vague concept."
"1751","Not a DS yet, but this is a good list. I need to brush up Eigenvectors though =3"
"1752","Sir, I deeply appreciate your answer. Also I have question. What if I have less interest for specific domain? Cuz I have less interest in finance than other domains.

I just got employed as junior DS for the first time in finance domain. I'm getting overwhelmed by my peers with special degree and also by lots of domain knowledge to learn.

I'm self-taught DS with just bachelor in economics.

Curiosity takes me to job landing, but all of a sudden my curiosity starts to fade out as I get overwhelmed. And I met your reply. Thank you."
"1753","Long term your best option is to change domains. Bioinformatics, healthcare, technology, etc. There are several industries to choose from.

As this is your first DS position, its important to successfully launch your career. Failure in your situation means moving forward without any professional DS experience.... Failure for someone more experienced might mean settling for a junior role, an under-compensated position, etc.

But for you, success here is key.... 

Personally I recommend staying in your position for 18-24 months (12 absolute minimum.) be hungry to learn, focus on modeling and methods, things that transfer to different domains. 

As for finance domain knowledge, listen to s podcast on your drive to work. Read the data driven investor (i believe thats the name).

Just be hungry to learn. Then after youve established yourself as an exceptional junio data scientist, switch roles to an industry that interests you more."
"1754","Thank you for reply, I thoroughly read what you said. I'll keep your advises in mind.

Also I have last questions..

1. How DS&amp;A helps data cleaning? Would you mind give an example?

2. You mean 'The Research Driven Investor' by timothy hayes, right?"
"1755","2. Yes

1. DS&amp;A come up all the time. Often youll need to define your own function to operate on SQL query returns, pandas columns etc. When you write a function, do you know how to evaluate its performance? Dont be the DS type where if pandas and sklearn cant do it, its impossible. Those people arent real data scientists, but they make it harder for actual candidates to get passed HR screenings. Those people are the absolute worst."
"1756","Thanks! During this week, I've seen in production a bit of what you saying.

Like %timeit in jupyter to evaluate performance. Resources are scarce. I gotta learn DS&amp;A. Appreciated."
"1757","Might be obvious and its just me not getting it - but what do you mean with DS&amp;A?"
"1758","Data structured and algorithms. 
DS: Linked list, binary trees, general trees, heaps, graphs, etc. 
A: depth first search, merge sort, etc."
"1759","Got it, thanks! 
And completely agree!"
"1760","Finally a list of what makes someone a good technical something that doesn't make me feel attacked"
"1761","Damn, I must be slipping. Normally I like to come at the rest of the world with a pipe wrench. Figuratively."
"1762","Well...Im good on the sleep thing!

(Actually good on may others but can always strive to be better)"
"1763","thank you for mentioning sleep. In grad school right now for Data Science and I'm making a better effort to get more sleep but its difficult when you are always so curious and excited to learn. Tips on how to get the mind off data science and actually sleep? I can handle the rest lol"
"1764","Well, in my case, having 1 professor and 1 therapist tell me to get 7.5-8 f***in hours if it kills me helped

Real answer: I find that it helps to ask yourself ""what would I do if I wasn't worried (about time pressure, the next project, etc)"" and frame it that way. Turns out the answer is sleep more and work earlier but more consistently."
"1765","Awesome list"
"1766","Are these ordered? If not, what are top 3 in your opinion?"
"1767","Not ordered, but I'm enough of an optimist to put ""willingness to put the work in to improve"" above most other qualities out there, for any skillset."
"1768","I love that you put domain knowledge on top. I've come into companies with a high level of domain knowledge and it helps in so many ways. I think people with high domain knowledge can make a huge impact with just ratio approximations and maximizing them over time with several a/b tests that don't meet any necessary assumptions. I did this at most of my jobs before I went back to school for math (studied communication in undergrad, so no math from 2002-2017) and it was highly effective."
"1769","In my humble opinion what a lot of data scientists lack is business context and understanding how to be practical. The best data scientists make the biggest impact, period. Even if you know everything about machine learning or can prove every statistical theory from the ground up, if you lack certain key skills you will never make an impact.

Since people don't often talk about this, I am looking to write a bit about it in the future but for now it is on hold. For me it's the number one mistake I see from poor candidates."
"1770","That's very shortsighted and is the reason behind political maneuvering to be in charge of low hanging fruit with low risk.  A company is diversified and can afford high risk high reward plays.  People can't afford to be extremely skilled, work their ass off, and still fail because of things outside their control.  This means low impact and no reward.  Thus the dynamic I mentioned happens and peoples inability to afford the risk is passed on into the company that could.  Further, the suckers get put on the risky projects, making them more likely to fail.  

You should reward individual contributors based on how much they are bringing to the table, given the circumstances they are in.  But that's impossible since only a maximum of a few people truly are observing that. Thus you have an inherently broken system."
"1771","I have always worked in small companies and had this narrow context in mind.

I tend to agree with your point in theory but in practice most projects I can think of are not complete successes or complete failures. Most of the time I think there is some value to be provided on the way."
"1772","Agreed, personally a data scientist who is technically proficient but lacks basic communication skills/ common sense is a bad data scientists. Not to say they cant contribute, but half of data science is communicating to your business users and teammates."
"1773","I feel like helps defining who the average data scientist is.

The average data scientist:

* Knows Python and/or R and is very comfortable training and evaluating machine learning models using existing libraries in those languages
* Struggles communicating with non-DS people
* Cares more about data science than anything else

I think those are the three prongs where data scientists can differentiate themselves and become ""good"":

* The specialist: has a broader skillset than just scripting languages, and therefore can help an organization by putting together more powerful solutions or tackling more challenging problems than the average DS.
* The talker: being able to communicate the value of DS is what actually allows DS teams to grow and find their place within organizations. It's not the value you create, but the value that people think you create and without this skill, your team is dead in the water.
* The business scientist: is able to drive business value using data science.

All teams need those three skills in order to truly mature. Without a specialist you'll eventually find yourself hinging your entire operation on shitty code deployed in shitty infrastructure. Without a talker, you will stagnate as a team because you won't get heads, budget, resources, etc. And without a business scientist you will just spin your wheels talking about what great technology you have, but will never actually deliver value to the organization."
"1774","Your responses are always top-notch. Very well said. 

Now, what we're all trying to figure out in this thread is: am I average or am I good? Ha!"
"1775","I dont think either of your second two points in the first section are negatives or characteristics of average data scientists at all. I think they are COMPLETELY orthogonal.

An average data scientist is someone who has a zero value above replacement skillset, whatever their focus is. Frankly, of all the things you could be good at, I'd argue your ""The talker"" is the one least likely to be a good data scientist if that is their primary skillset. Thats a DS manager skill; but many of us just want to be ICs.

I probably have a stilted opinion being right on the dividing line between DS and MLE where the main thing keeping me titled as the former is that employers want me to focus on NN architecture first, but I have never tried to hide that I don't care about anything other than ML and I look like that meme of Charlie Day when I try to explain ANYTHING, and I am paid sig. above market which suggests at least \_someone\_ thinks Im above average.

All that said as per usual while my perspective differs a bit I do think yours is valid and well reasoned. I just think there are other ways to succeed in this industry, especially once your DS functionality starts to branch out past UX research, A/B testing, client reporting statistics, etc. that actually involve client (internal or external) interaction and starts being more engineering adjacent."
"1776","I have a few (and more, but I think I already typed too much). I'm sure many will disagree with some, but this is what came to my mind.

1) Understanding The Why

Perhaps this is the difference between a poor and average, but it's something I see at my workplace as a differentiator. I find the better data scientists (or any professional) understand why any given best practice and general guideline is used and know when they can and should consider breaking them. They can explain why any given action they performed was done that way because they've thought about it (hint: ""because that's how we always do it"" or ""because that's what my professor/mentor/... said"" is never the right answer). Better data scientists question everything and consider the pros and cons of various options. 

2) Statistics and Math Knowledge

I don't think you necessarily have to be the primary driver on your team in this area, but you should have a solid background in both and be regularly be challenging yourself to improve in these areas. I've seen a trend popping up (at least in my area) where people are getting ""data science"" M.S. degrees where linear algebra and multivariable calculus aren't even part of the prerequisites or degree program. Even people that have the background often seem to forget it after a while or at least get rusty. Stay sharp and keep learning.

3) Your job is to bring value to your employer

Your primary objective of any position is to bring value to the company. Everything you focus on should be bringing value (either directly or indirectly) and justifying your position. I'll often see what I consider average data scientists to lose sight of this and focus on things they find interesting instead of what meets the needs of the business (I think this is common in all scientists, but it's something to keep in mind). 

While skill building and exploration can be valuable they shouldn't dominate your time. Don't ask to spend months researching and implementing a new machine learning algorithm when a linear regression model would meet the needs of the business.

4) Communication with business stakeholders

I find that the better data scientists are almost always better at communicating to less technical people. In any setting you should know who your audience is and have a gauge for how technical you should be. Better data scientists can match the information with the audience, not just in terms they can understand but motivate it with why they should care about it.

5) Understand where you are in the process and ensure that you can integrate your work appropriately

I can't tell you how many data science products I've seen go to waste because they didn't establish a plan of how the final product will integrate with the business before starting it. Usually they'll ensure that they're building models and making predictions that WOULD be of value to specific users (e.g., asking other departments/teams if having a model to do X would help them), but they don't plan on how it would actually get used. Would it be an excel sheet? an API? a dashboard? Do the users have the skills, time, permissions, resources to access it? Can it be integrated into their other products they're already using?"
"1777","Yeah...We have a data analyst that is finishing up a program like that and Ive had to interview candidates from programs like that. Their machine learning classes are entirely based on blindly tuning different hyperparameters in scikit-learn. 

I lead my departments data science team. I tried encouraging the analyst (who is in the same department and trying to do more data science work) to learn linear algebra and vector calc either individually or take a class at the local college on it as it would be necessary to do much of the work they wanted to do and to get jobs in the field. They assured me that data scientists dont need to know those things...I simply wished them luck."
"1778","Seriously, that makes no sense. If you don't have a good handle on multivariate calculus and at least some rudimentary knowledge of linear algebra you're going to have a bad time. How do they even teach the probability theory and mathematical statistics courses in that program?

I should mention that I don't have a masters or PhD, but it's still mind-boggling that they don't require those courses. Those are undergraduate level courses and are vital to success. You can't build a good house without a foundation."
"1779","If you understand derivatives/integration and matrix operations, you can be a more than capable data scientist. Thats like a week or two from what youd learn in several semesters of calc and linear algebra."
"1780","I think someone with that limited of a math background may be able to do some data science, but theyd never be a good data scientist. They would have to rely too heavily on standardized packages and models and wouldnt be able to see when shortcuts could be made or when a custom algorithm would be superior."
"1781","Here's a [medium article that sheds some light on that](https://towardsdatascience.com/becoming-a-level-3-0-data-scientist-52641ff73cb3) ."
"1782","Thanks a lot. Have read this already. Looking for more opinions and details from the sub"
"1783","Ah great! In addition to what the author mentions, I think being able to motivate e.g ML models to management &amp; a strong focus on key business objectives are what seperate a great data scientist from a good data scientist. 

Good data scientists may be able to explain ML models to other data scientists, but struggle with other teams. They are not always clear on how data science will impact the key objectives."
"1784","Got a mirror? That link isn't working for me."
"1785","Open the link in an incognito tab in your browser"
"1786","I would say statistical knowledge, and knowing how to communicate results to a non-technical audience."
"1787","Start charging triple and just tell them what they want to hear. Fuck those assholes."
"1788","Isn't that part of knowing how to communicate results to a non-technical audience?"
"1789","This is so important! I'm not quite a data scientist, I'm in a data management role with an epidemiology background, and I find I spend a significant amount of time with data scientists working with them to communicate results in a way that makes sense to non technical people :)"
"1790","Level of engagement, systemic thinking that branches out into understanding implications on business and infrastructure (basically, have broader context), ability to sell the idea of data driven innovation. 

First 3 that popped in my head."
"1791","Can you elaborate on the level of engagement aspect?"
"1792","I'll put it in a question form. Are you just focusing on your current task, or are you willing to go and fight for your project?

I'm of course biased by my own experience, but more often than not - what makes a difference for your idea to lift off, is the persistence and notion that you need this project at least as much as your client."
"1793","I find it kind of distressing that this thread is filled predominantly with technical answers. 

If I have to pinpoint the most likely success criterion among my colleagues over the years I'd say it's the ability to play well with others. The ability to accept your (even if current or temporary) ignorance and work with other people for our collective good is hands down the most important attribute. It makes you more hospitable, it ensures that domain expertise is shared with you, it allows you to leverage expertise in areas beyond your own, especially in business and development, and most importantly it makes you a fun person to work with. That opens far more doors than any technical skills will."
"1794","Depth of knowledge.

While it's easy to get average results, going the extra mile will take a LOT of effort and knowledge. That extra mile very often makes a huge difference.

You see this all the time. On Kaggle, in Academia or even in the industry. There is a good attempt with vanilla techniques and then there is a huge gap and then there is some dudes with the state of the art where you'd need to have a PhD in that niche to be able to come up with it.

In my experience jumping that gap is what makes products ready for production use, what makes models ""almost perfect"" and so on. 

For example a project I worked on was NLP related and we were challenged to come up with something better than what they already had (some product from one of the vendors). One of the team members had a PhD in NLP and worked in NLP for over a decade. He came up with the idea of pre-training our off-the-keras-tutorial-shelf model with a carefully crafted domain specific dataset instead of the standard kitchen sink variety pre-training the vendors used. Our model ended up jumping the gap and blew everyone else out of the water. 

Plenty off projects I worked on where there was some guy that had plenty of experience with that particular niche (PhD's out of academia tend to have that) and due to sheer depth of knowledge was able to get MUCH better results than the rest of us.

My suggestion is once you got the basics covered, go very deep in one area. For example unsupervised clustering or association rules or small tabular data or big sequential data or NLP or whatever it might be."
"1795","Ive often hear people say on this sub that a lot of companies prefer the quick ""average"" solution over the perfect one. And that people from academia find it hard to stop when they have an okey solution instead diving deeper and spending a lot more time on the same problem. 

 I assume that the average solution would be good enough when dealing with customer data or something. But in medical or technical fields they want more than average. Any thoughts on this?"
"1796","Most ""data scientists"" don't work on stuff that ever goes in production. They're glorified data/business intelligence analysts. That's why most people care more about statistics than software engineering skills on this sub.

If you start working on things in production you'll notice that the real world is slightly different.

Simplest example I can come up with is that you don't have the whole dataset available in production. Data comes in all the time and it's not like you can afford to recompute everything thousands of times per second. Sometimes there are delays, sometimes some of the data isn't available and so on. Often the phenomenon you're trying to model changes all the time, it's not necessarily a static thing. Freshmen statistics (maybe even entirety of undergrad statistics) fly right out of the window at that point, online statistical algorithms is pretty complicated shit that I personally did not encounter in college.

Work these ""data scientists"" do rarely matters. Their analysis ends up on a powerpoint or a dashboard somewhere and as they discussed in the other thread, the higher ups will just ignore it if it doesn't match their current vision.

When you're working on production stuff, it usually has a measurable effect on something that matters. For example if you're A/B testing user interfaces, you might measure that the better interface leads to an increase in sales. Replacing A/B testing with a fancier multi-armed bandit might lead to finding those better interfaces much faster with a lot less ""waste"". If you're doing a recommender system you might find that improving the quality gives you a bump in sales that you can see in the charts with your own eyes.

In my opinion, if what you are working on doesn't matter then why are you working on it? I am baffled that people put up with shit like making reports that are then ignored. Why make reports then? Tell them to fuck off and go do something that's actually important."

"1798","I deal with NLP a lot at work and I gotta ask (cas Im still very much new to the NLP world) how does one carefully craft a domain specific dataset? Was it something like USE combined with a manually crafted stop words list? Seems like a lot of manual effort and heuristic guess work (which is valid if it works lol)"
"1799","I can give you an example:

In my industry, the consumers use a lot of slang terms, and come up with them fairly regularly. As a result, if we were to train an NLP model, it would be much better doing it on a large database of text specific to that community.

Reddit is actually pretty good for this, since there are things like pushshift that allow you to get large amounts of comment data from specific communities really fast.

So, if I were to be working for a music company, and I want to know generally impressions of various artists, one way to train the model would to be to pull text data from online magazines and communities associated to the genres the musicians work in."
"1800","As a data scientist your main objective should be finding insight and communicating this insights to key decisions makers.

"1801","I think effectively it all comes down to having:

1. Good technical skills
2. Good soft skills

A lot of average data scientists have one and not the other - the best ones have both"
"1802","Basically just soft skills...convincing other people to do things, understanding which problems to work on and which problems don't matter, knowing enough about the business and your discipline to drive PnL.  Same as any field or job description, really."
"1803","I think this is already contained in other answers in different phrasing. For me an average data scientist will give the right answers to a question and a good data scientist will come up with their own questions. That means understanding what the product/project needs and actually caring about it."

\- Ability to think end to end: Not just how do I solve this problem but also how do I know that I have solved it, how do I monitor/dashboard it, etc.

\- Better communication: Ability to explain the problem, the approach for solution, and results to both engineers that may be technical but not necessarily familiar with DS and non-technical audiences."
"1815","A good data scientist can code and write tools to let you manipulate and/or visualize the data."
"1816","To put it into a high level summary - if you can be just as skilled in; framing business problems, focusing on the end-user, communication &amp; problem solving as you are in the latest tech and tools you'll be a great Data Scientist.

"1818","Good DS needs to have sufficient technical depth in their domain, ie, know most modeling approaches and have DL skills to architect a custom solution if required.

I guess on an embedded chess computer you are using c which is rather difficult if you want to apply oop principles."
"1831","This is an aside, but:

I'm ashamed to admit it but I was mystified by the little C and C++ (yes I know the difference) I was exposed to in college (circa 2015) (and I guess I still am, because I haven't pursued anything in either of the languages since). I feel like the only reason I was able grasp programming in this era is because of the powerful abstraction modern languages provide. I'm mid 30s, and I remember thinking to myself after seeing some C++ in the early 2000s, that it all looked like hieroglyphics to me, and that I could never be a programmer.

Yeah, I know Java was around then. But this was all through my frame of reference and what I was exposed to. I thought it was all as confusing as that. Modern OOP languages make ""talking in programming"" (if that makes sense) much easier, both in learning environments and among others you work with."
"1832","You could *probably* layer OOP on top of an actually-good chessboard representation with minimal runtime overhead.

"1840","you use an abstract class when you have predefined behavior that you want to apply to all inheriting classes. you use an interface when you want to prescribe that the implementing class implements a method for you, commonly useful in IoC, or for dependency injection."

"1842","If you dont know what pattern you are applying to the problems you are solving, then in all likelihood you are probably creating anti patterns."
"1843","Some people have a decent intuition on this and experience teaches you what works and what doesnt... you would only know the names if you are more formally educated."
"1844","Just because something works doesnt mean its NOT an antipattern. You can write all the spaghetti code you want, just because it works doesnt mean its quality or that it is maintainable.

"1845","K"
"1846","I learn the patterns from my senior so I doubt I'm creating anti patterns. I just don't know the names as the other comment said."
"1847","OOP specifically shouldn't be required, at least not beyond a very basic level.  But, the thing interviewers are really looking for with OOP questions (which they often don't even understand is what they're actually asking) is whether you can logically analyze a problem and model a system that represents it reasonably.  That is very much a skill you must have... but that doesn't automatically mean OOP.  It's just that OOP is the common language we all generally speak in this field.

A good interviewer won't so much care if you can design a perfect object hierarchy with all sorts of polymorphic behavior and abstract classes and perfect interface design.  They'll care that what you outline makes logical sense and is a reasonable model of whatever problem they give you.

When I interview, my favorite is to ask the candidate to describe how they would model their computer's file system with OOP techniques.  I have no specific answer in mind, but I expect to hear things like a class to represent a directory, one for files, and maybe there's a collection of files stored in a directory, that sort of thing.  The specifics aren't important, only that it's logical and in the ballpark."
"1848","I'm actually going to tell you how I'd do it, since I have already been doing some work on this problem for an implementation of 'FORTH' that I'm writing:

Firstly, I create a common superclass 'Node'.  This superclass has fields:

* 'Type': Runtime type of a node.  We will need to know what the type of the node is at runtime somehow if we can't 'nicely' assume it (we can't), and its good to avoid empty fields in the superclass that should belong in their respective subclasses.
* 'Next': Pointer to the node that comes after this one.  Since a file system is a search structure with a potentially unlimited number of nodes, we should have a way to easily iterate over them.  If every node has a 'Next' field, then we can at least establish a single linked list containing every node in the filesystem (but we won't because directories can give us exponential speedups (no exaggeration) due to making things into a tree-like structure).
* 'Previous': Pointer to the previous node.  Doubly linked lists are nice.
* 'Name': Name of / key for the current node.  Acts as a key for this specific node (makes more sense with files, which effectively have their value as their contents).  We can list all of these (tail) recursively or iteratively to show the nodes accessible as direct descendants of the 'current directory' (which is a useful construct that's probably too much for this post), or perhaps recursively through multiple directories.

Then, class 'Directory' is a pretty simple extension to this:

* 'First': Pointer to the first node contained 'within' a directory.  This is a pointer to a different node from 'Next', and is used for realizing a filesystem's tree-like structure.

Class 'File' is also a pretty simple extension to class 'Node':

* 'Data': A pointer to the (unfragmented, for simplicity) actual data blocks of the file from *on disk*.

I suppose that a semi-accurate way to explain this structure is to call it a recursively-nestable associative array.  It must be constructed using 'Name' fields since humans must be able to use this structure conveniently, and it should be tree-like so that CRUD operations can be implemented quickly.

This is all a much-more simplified example than a real filesystem since different real-world filesystems try to accomplish different goals.  Heck, these are only the *fields* that I've listed, and I haven't even talked about any of the methods involved, symlinks (including '.', '..', '/', etc.)), journaling, inodes, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**Obviously, filesystems can get pretty complicated!**

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I have been applying for about 2 months using websites like indeed, stackoverflow, and monster, and have gone to a job fair at my college (which I graduated from recently).  I have applied to \~15-20 jobs so far, and have only gotten responses from 2 of them (1 of which had a 1st interview with me on the phone, but didn't respond afterward, while the other just wasn't interested).

I've gotten help from a couple of people with formatting my resume as well, one of them being a very knowledgeable English teacher.  So, though I may be mistaken, I am not under the impression that there is anything inherently wrong with my resume.

&amp;#x200B;

**Could you help me to understand what I'm doing incorrectly so that I can present myself to employers properly and ultimately get hired, while show them that juggling concepts like pointers and data structures around is laughably easy for me?**"
"1849","Well, you asked a fairly general question that I don't really have enough information to properly answer... but in terms of critiquing your answer to my question... the question is meant to allow for a lot of variation in answers, so when I look at yours, I don't see anything outright wrong per se.  You seem to be basically describing a linked list structure, and at the level of files and directories, I'm not sure that's how you would do it (certainly it would be when you get down to the block level).  On the other hand, I can't say for sure that you COULDN'T make a file system work that way.

So, as I said, nothing I'd say is wrong per se, and it wouldn't matter anyway because I'm not looking for a ""right"" or ""wrong"" answer.

What your answer tells me is that you have a grasp of data structures and that you can think things through.  You're fresh out of school at this point, and it seems obvious that you've learned well there, but now you have to learn to translate what is to a large extent the theoretical knowledge in your mind into real-world solutions.  It takes time for most people to learn that (and there's no one-size-fits-all answer to indicate when you're accomplished that either - always remember that a lot of this field is open to interpretation and differing viewpoints, it's not as rigid as other engineering disciplines tend to be, for the most part).

The only thing I would suggest considering is whether you're over-thinking things.

This is a common mistake for new developers I find because it's a learned skill to be able to simplify your thinking when you're starting out and have had schooling, but simplifying is a vital skill.  It's very easy to write overly complex solutions in this field, and that can be just as bad as writing outright bad code.  Note that I'm not saying you HAVE over-thought this answer, because that's frequently a debatable point... I'm just saying that learning how to step back and look at a problem and ask yourself ""is this the simplest possible solution that will work?"" is a skill that you have to develop.  Sometimes the answer is ""yep, this is a complicated problem and it necessarily has a complicated solution"", but oftentimes you'll realize that you've taken things too far.

This is important because one of the key things to being successful in software development long-term (and, for reference, I've been a professional developer/architect for 25 years now) is writing highly maintainable code.  It's something a lot of people don't seem to understand.  When you write a solution for a business, they want something that's going to stand the test of time and that they will be able to hire people to work on for a long time.  One of the best strategies for accomplishing this is keeping things as simple as possible because simplicity is easier to understand.  You have to remember that even if you're super-coder, the next guy that has to maintain your stuff may not be.  The more complex the solution is to begin with, the tougher it's going to be for them.

The only other thing I can think to say is that the amount of time you've been looking, the number of jobs you've applied to, the response rate, all of that, seems roughly right.  If anything, you may not be applying to as many positions as you can.  One mistake a lot of new graduates make is looking at job postings and thinking ""yeah, I can't do that job"".  Now, you have to be careful here because obviously there's going to be many that you really can't, but don't dismiss every job posting that seems beyond you because many of them actually aren't.  Many (most?) job postings are written by HR drones who just throw every buzzword they know into it, sometimes with ridiculously humorous results (like a recent post by someone who mentioned a posting wanting something like 10 years experience with Flutter - a technology that's existed for MAYBE 3 years!)  Apply for things that seem over your head a bit because the worst that can happen is you get turned down.  But, sometimes, you'll find that they actually don't need all the crap they asked for and will take someone less experienced.  Just be polite and respectful and don't lie when asked a question even if the answer seems like not a good one for your chances.  Worst you can get is a no."
"1850","Yeah, that makes sense.  I'm getting some pretty strong 'Agile Programming' vibes from this.  Realistically, the simplest working solution would probably just be an on-disk version of malloc (though I shudder at the thought of using that seriously).  I'd also heard some things about HR people writing silly job postings before, so I'll definitely try to take them less seriously.  

Thank you for your thoughtful answer.  Guess I'll just keep chugging for now!"
"1851","Just know when to make a function, both inside and outside of a class."
"1852","Yes of course."
"1853","If to you can create a class/module or two you should be fine WRT oop.

Can you understand the problem and requirements (clarifying questions welcome)? Can you find good (doesn't have to be strictly optimal) solutions to the problem and justify/compare them? Can you implement the solution? Can you avoid major bugs in your implementation or find and eliminate them? Can you explain some parts of the problem/implementation in interesting technical detail?

If the answer to all of those is confident yes then you are golden. If none of those answers is a clear no, you may have a chance."
"1854","They wouldn't expect a fresher to know a lot. Here are some things I think would help you.

* Have a great attitude.
* They would expect you to pick up things quickly.
* You should raise any blockers or ask for help whenever necessary. You will need a lot of help initially. Don't think that they will judge you if you admitted you didnt know something. No one knows everything. 
* Make sure you don't  repeat the same mistakes. 
* Make sure you understand the requirements clearly before picking up a task. Have a discussion with your lead or PM if necessary. 
* Always test your code before pushing. Even if it's a  one line change.
* Make sure the happy flow is always working. 
* Always make sure you don't push unnecessary lines of code. Make sure you have clean, readable non duplicated code.
* Communicate to your lead if you need more time to complete tasks. Dont wait for the deadline to tell this to your lead. That can affect the next sprint plans. 
* They would expect you to complete the tasks on time.
* You should research on given tasks before you start coding. There probably will be an efficient way to do it which you may not have known. 
* Good googling skills.
* Make sure you understand what you code. Do not just copy paste from stack overflow. Try to have good understanding of the tech stacks you work with.
* Make sure you get feedback from your lead occasionally."
"1855","The only things I disagree with: 
    They do expect you to pickup things quickly but its okay to make the same mistakes and if you feel a little slow while doing it its fine. 
     They definitely dont expect you to complete your tasks on time because the task is probably more complex than you think due to unfamiliarity with the code."
"1856","That's like the default scenario with no error or exceptional cases."

"1858","A) you should be fine. Also I assume you took C and Java if you've got a degree.

B) in a year from now, you'll wonder how you ever got away with saying you ""know"" anything. 5 years later you'll wonder how that kid with one year of experience ever thought he knew those languages. 10 years later you'll only know that you know nothing, and that it may simply be that it is impossible to know anything..."
"1859","Not all schools teach java these days, just fyi, at my school the curriculum is mostly either C++ or Python, the only classes that use Java have the word in their name."
"1860","It's interesting how you've assumed T-SQL is the default. SQL is a widely known standard, and IMO if a resume has that keyword but no other hints it would be a misstep to make any assumptions about server side logic like plSQL/T-SQL."
"1861","Yeah Ive been doing software engineering professionally for 10 years now and had no idea what T-SQL was until I googled it"
"1862","when i was a new grad in Cali I got grilled with leetcode easy's and just simple questions about fundamentals of OOP.

They're mass hiring entry level devs. Thing is, one of the requirements is 1+ years of experience. I haven't had any internships or work experience but I do have some projects and I'm fairly comfortable with most of the other stuff they're asking about. Should I apply?"
"1864","Apply. Most likely they won't even interview you but you may get lucky. if you dont apply you def wont get an interview."
"1865","That makes sense, thanks."
"1866","This is the main thing that's worrying me, my resume being nuked by a filter before it gets to anyone."
"1867","Worst case scenario, you won't get the job so that's the same as not applying.

Thing is, if you are not really lucky you will have to apply multiple times until you get an interview and then probably some for an offer. I've been looking for a job for the last two months, all but one were rejects, some just after looking after resume, some after sending them the task but you will find a job eventually.

Good luck!"
"1868","No, the worst case scenario is the job fairy reading over his resume and being so annoyed by it, beats him with a sock full of nickels in his sleep."
"1869","Yeah I think I'll just go ahead and apply. Thanks!"
"1870","One thing that helps is reaching out to a recruiter on LinkedIn and just tell them something in the line of ""how you applied and never heard back, but you're still interested and would like an opportunity to interview with them"". It's not guaranteed but I have gotten a few interviews through this approach."
"1871","Microsoft definitely asks Leetcode questions. For me, my first application to Microsoft took 9 months before they got back. So, get into the system!"
"1872","Wait what? Really? I'm a college freshman and I applied to their Explore Internship around mid September but never heard back. Not a single thing.

I do realize it is way too late for them to reach out to me for an internship but I guess it can take several months long before they reach out to you?"
"1873","It can. However, there may be cases where they get back to you fast. Many top companies can take months or even years before they get back

Also, it's reliant on hiring waves. There's one around January through March, one around June-July, and one later in the year. I tend to do horribly around the Thanksgiving one"
"1874","I got asked a leetcode hard for a MS intern interview. Definitely be prepared"
"1875","I've started working on some lc easy's and I'll work up to the rest. Thanks for the advice!"
"1876","when did you start applying to entry level roles?? how soon before graduating?"
"1877","Most of my classmates started applying beginning of fall semester for a spring graduation. The good students got job offers before winter break. The bad students got jobs in the month or so before graduation."
"1878","Then Im a horrible student. Graduated with no job offer."
"1879","I'm speaking very specifically and anecdotally about the people who graduated in my program/year, not anyone else. I'm even only speaking about the ones I knew well enough to both know their plans and have an opinion on their abilities. It's not a formula."
"1880","Im just messing around haha, I understand you."
"1881","Some people start applying the semester before their last semester, and in general, you should try to begin applying at the beginning of your last semester at the latest.

Sometimes the interview process can take months so this is a good way to ensure that you have a job lined up after graduation. If you start now you should be safe."
"1882","Brute force solutions are good enough 50% of the time. Something people wont tell you lol"
"1883","it IS a standardized test. and like most of those they arent that useful as a measure of what they are supposed to be measuring (coding ability), but you have no choice but to face them to get into the places that use them"
"1884","What is OOP?"
"1885","object oriented programming"
"1886","I think the biggest thing is the ability to learn.  Knowledge of programming languages, frameworks, etc., is helpful, but anyone can learn a different language easily with good knowledge of OOP.  You'll probably have to have your hand held for some time during your first jobs, or even first few jobs maybe.  Having some skills is useful but definitely emphasize your ability to learn, because every company does some things differently."
"1887","Start looking for jobs now, just have your graduation date on your resume. 

I expect ds&amp;a type knowledge in addition to a fairly strong familiarity with any given language. Obviously if I'm looking for a C developer, being familiar with C is a huge plus. I'd definitely consider somebody who feels very confident in Java and had used C a bit as well though.

Transitioning from one language to another isn't the end of the world. So yeah, basically show off what you can do in your best language. To be clear, these are my expectations for a new grad."
"1888","What do you consider strong familiarity as, with Java for example? Grading myself, and knowing what I should be learning to be useful has been difficult for me."
"1889","Oh boy. That could prove difficult. Instead of looking at it that way, my point was simply ranking how experienced *you* feel you are in each language. The takeaway here is that you don't necessarily need to be very strong in a specific language, provided that you're strong in *a* language."
"1890","That's fair. I have an Associate's degree where I focused on Java and similar languages. But since then I've had little time to build on my knowledge or watch videos and I'm not quite at the level where I can lurk around on posts and understand even half of what's going on in them.

I'm not sure if it's me, or if I'm just not finding resources that fit the way I learn things. I've thought about internships, but they all want Bachelor's degrees and experience and I'm a crap at discerning when a posting is exaggerating or what I can do to be considered.

This post is probably one of the only posts I've seen on this sub or similar ones that didn't consist of ""never give up!"" or FAANG something or other."
"1891","Programming to me was one of those things which I really struggled with at university, I couldn't grasp some of the concepts and I didn't understand what I was really doing.

So I was super nervous when interviewing but when I got my first job though my rate of improvement shot through the roof, everything started clicking together, a couple of years later it was basically second nature. I'm now 10 years in and it's something I still enjoy."
"1892","Yeah I definitely think on the job training would be a lot more useful than strict classroom learning, but I understand why companies don't exactly jump on that train.

I recently realized a better metaphor for classes that helps me understand is to see them as factories, rather than hierarchies. You program how it produces and make objects from it. I dislike the hierarchy analogy because you neither change nor produce anything from a classification like ""animals can be dogs or cats""."

"1919","Tips for improving communication skills and enthusiasm?"
"1920","Attentive persistence. Keep trying to get things done you are assigned. Know when to ask for help, too often you become an annoying burden to some people, not often enough, you waste time trying things that are never going to succeed.

Be mindful of others' time. Don't have meetings when an email could suffice.  Don't ask people questions every 15 minutes, ask them twice a day, bundle up your questions to only interrupt them once.

The most difficult thing for software pros is trying to find multiple hours of uninterrupted time to get into deep focus into what you are doing. Every interruption pulls them out of that focus and have to start over their thought process. Set up 15-30 minute meetings on their calendar immediately AFTER other meetings. If you set it up before, you may be making it difficult for them to prepare for the meeting, but that still may be okay, use your judgement.  If they have a block of time from 2pm - 5pm open, do it at 2pm, not at 3:30pm which would trash their focus in the middle of a 3 hour stretch.

Good communication skills, that you can share ideas clearly, both to other technical people and the business-type people who don't speak Python, C#, or JavaScript.

No ego. People early in their careers especially feel they have to prove themselves. Do it with your actions, not your words."
"1921","Social skills. 

Seriously. You will be more likely to get the job if you seem like a good person to work with.

Obviously your technical skills will need to be up to scratch, but showing the interviewers that they're not going to hate you after spending 8 hours a day, 5 days a week working with you will go a long way. 

Full disclosure: based on my experience in Europe"
"1922","I got leetcode mediums from Google (failed onsite), and leetcode hard from Amazon (failed web screening).

The offer I got had basic Java/OO questions (e.g. interface vs abstract class, name 3 design patterns..) and generic behavioural questions. Also talked about projects on my github."
"1923","Oof they never taught us any of this stuff in college.."
"1924","You didn't lean OOP in college?"
"1925","Learned OOP but never even heard of design patterns... we did like 1 week on interface classes so that I know a little bit of."
"1926","read the gang of 4 book"
"1927","Most of the real answers are covered: Object Oriented Design, Data Structures and Algorithms, and basic time/space complexity. Some places will also expect you to know how to implement api's and frameworks, maybe IDE's, git or other version control is common, sometimes databases, etc.

So I'll just give you what my boss told me: ""I expect bare minimum technical knowledge. After that all I'm looking for is: the ability to learn and if you can think laterally. You meet that bar and I think I can work with you, that's good enough for me.""

He also said: ""You can teach anyone with at least some technical ability to write code, but you can't teach them how to learn or how to think outside the box, and if they can't do that they will only be able to go so far."""
"1928","Many software developers don't have good communication skills. If you are in that camp, consider joining the likes of Toastmasters or anything to help with your communication skills. 

&gt; Also, when do graduates usually start looking for post-grad entry-level jobs?? Is now too soon?

Never. As you expect to graduate, you can apply early. There are hot months and cold months when it comes to when companies search for candidates. The top tier companies do not adhere to the recruiting schedules, but the reality is that you might have to gain experience at other places. 

Even if you are graduating a year from now, you can go to job fairs and ask the recruiter what they are looking for. They might not know, but at least you might be able to get a job description

Try to pace yourself. Also, some consulting companies are absolute shit. If they miss a phone call by more than 10 minutes, start wondering if you should keep talking to them. Make an Excel sheet of places you applied to both via contracting and full-time. 

ESPECIALLY keep track of which contracting companies got you any interviews and which ones have been a pain in the ass. Feel free to ask the recruiter if there's a homework assignment. I even ended up being asked to solve a mess that THEY created, and luckily I realized that I should nope out of ever talking to them ever again

The job hunting process can be stressful as hell. If a consultancy is causing you a lot of stress (example: continually missed phone calls/too many cold calls/they call you an hour late), dump them. 

I found myself having to micromanage recruiters, and realized that the ones I have to really micromanage usually end up not being worth it. Companies need to realize that recruiters are a face of your company. 

If you ever have worked with the likes of a Google recruiter, holy shit. It feels like they rolled out the red carpet. They are easy to get a hold of. They talk you every step of the way, and they are incredibly considerate.

For skills, a lot of the times, it'll be in job descriptions. There's also many hints about the company in the descriptions"
"1929","This is why, as a returning student who finished his CS degree in his mid-30's, I found it incredibly easy to get an offer once I was able to get myself in front of interviewers face to face. I had built a really good toolkit of communication skills learned from jobs in other industries (primarily customer service and banking) and with my technical acumen, was able to stand out from the crowd because I could carry on both technical and soft skill conversations with ease. It cannot be understated enough how much gaining a really good understanding of how to communicate effectively can make the interview process much easier. Doing things like mock interviews and public speaking practice can help sharpen this skill."

Work hard. 

Actively seek out ways to improve yourself.

Show me all the above and Ill pay you well and put you in a position to thrive."
"1934","Depends a lot on the company you're applying to. I've had some really simple interviews with LC easy, basic OOP, and problem solving. 

I felt that some of the interviews in the Bay we're honestly a little insane. LC Mediums / Hard + MapReduce system design questions + distributed system questions around concurrency, edge case handling, system failure handling through data and application redundancy. This was definitely material not taught in class and definitely required serious outside study to answer to a decent degree. I had interviews were I answered everything optimally (albeit a little slower than I would've liked) but didn't get the job.

The answer is that it varies."
"1935","In an interview:

* mostly basic LC medium level type questions.

* communicate about what your overall approach is and what you're doing. If you ace the entire question but refuse to speak, you will probably get a weak yes. If you do not ace the question and refuse to speak, you will probably get a no. If you do acceptably on the question but communicate extremely well in a way that leads me to believe you know what you're doing and are on the right track, you will probably salvage at minimum a weak yes. 

* comments and unit tests in an interview are not necessary to me, but if you do them and still have time to finish I will be impressed

* OTOH, I *do* expect code to be well-factored, variables to be appropriately named, use functions as necessary, etc. Non-native English speakers in particular, this may be a place to improve. I beg of you, do not write your variable names in pinyin and then comment the Chinese characters.

On the job:

* basic terminal usage. It always amazes me when I hear about somebody in an interview or on the job who doesn't even know how to open the terminal. I'm not asking for anything fancy, just the basics.

* git or other version control. Again, nothing fancy, just the basics.

* ability to complete basic tasks with minimal assistance. Obviously there is ramping up on a code base, but you shouldn't need spoonfeeding of every minor step.

* communication skills. Communicate project status to the team and boss. Communicate blockers to whoever they're relevant to. Coordinate features with other teams that may own the part of the code base you need to change.

* ability to attempt to proactively problem solve. Did you Google it, search stack overflow, search the internal knowledge base, look at the code, talk to owning team, etc or do you have to run to your boss/tech lead any time anything goes slightly wrong?

* a database technology of some type, generally SQL. Nothing insane, but ability to write basic queries, some concept of database design.

* a statically typed language like java/c

* a dynamically typed language like Javascript, python, or ruby.

* ""Coachable"". Ability to take criticism positively and improve.

* motivation to learn and expand their role."
"1936","Someone who asks a lot of questions, quick at learn and investigating problems, passion for CS"
"1937","Things I needed to know that I didn't have 100% when I started were GitHub/git especially conflict resolution, jira, docker, postman, better debugging habbits, full stack debugging skills, and how to reach out for help after investigating thoroughly but not spending too much time on one issue."
"1938","Be able to code, knowledge of fundamentals, especially data structures, and interest in learning. That's it, nothing else. Especially not knowledge/experience with specific languages or tools.

If your prospective manager, during an interview, places an undue emphasis on you knowing specifically version X.Y of a framework Z, or uses wording similar to ""we're a ${LANGUAGE} shop here"", run (provided you have the ability to do so)."
"1939","Are you a good friend? Can you project that to a group of random people in an hour? This may depend on what type of team you are looking to join, but it was really important that we like the people we interview. Like a comedian working a room, you should be able to banter with your interviewer(s) without coming across as judgmental or abrasive.  Take an interest in them, they may appreciate it more than your leetcode efficiency."
"1940","I want you to know how to solve problems, and know when to ask for help. I can teach you a language. I can't and don't have time to teach you problem solving and critical thinking. 

Don't put on your resume that you basically breathe air, trying to mask the fact you're a new engineer. I will know the second we start speaking.

Articulate to me why you like a specific language and at least show some excitement for trying new things. Embrace change.

These are the things all engineers I have managed or worked with have not been very good at in the past."
"1941","I'm also graduating in May and I started looking at jobs around October, although I haven't started to actively apply until mid-January. I've been invited to the final onsite interview for a couple of companies so I think I have some advice I can give.

What I found is that showing genuine interest in a company and just being an overall nice person goes a long way. Asking questions specific to the company and/or your role shows interest. Also, admitting when you don't know something (but can reasonably logic it out) is much better than flailing around pretending you know it. Knowing how to think out loud is always a plus. Repeat the question and ask clarifying details if necessary. I think it also helps to have a trail of personal projects so companies know that you like learning new things and are a 'self-starter' (ugh, I hate that word)

In terms of technical skills, I've been asked about SQL queries, OOP fundamentals, some leetcode problems (easy/medium? I don't do leetcode), memory management, and also some case studies. They also ask about any internship experiences or anything else you've done (quantify your successes if possible). Behavioral questions I've been asked include 'Tell me about yourself', 'Why do you want to work here', 'What's your greatest strength/weakness', and 'Where do you see yourself in 5 years'."
"1942","learn a version control, learn how to write a unit test, be able to pass a basic programming logic test like fizzbuzz level but won't necessarily be that. The first two are really me being a picky bitch, mildly sickened by having to explain those to people with years or experience. If the job title I was interviewing for said junior that's what I would ask. I used to fish for more knowledge basically for fun, but that backfires on the candidate when the manager who in the room who doesn't know things hears they don't know things.

You're going to want to apply at a larger company, not necessarily google(I mean give it a shot for lols why not) but something like accenture or generagl dynamics size/level; big but not a meme. Small companies with like a handful of devs don't have spare train junior spots/money. One of the things that keeps junior spots existing is seniors wanting them as almost a job perk/benefit, if you get a competent one just right and actually train them some you can totes pass what's annoying boring shit to you off onto them and they'll love it."
"1943","Have 10 years of experience as a React developer /s  

But seriously, entry level implies that you have a sound understanding of basic design patterns and software engineering best practices, and perhaps have a basic understanding of things like SQL or NoSQL, testing, that you are curious and willing to learn, that you are willing to fail gracefully and learn from mistakes, that you can take direction from senior devs and not spin your wheels too long when you encounter a blocker, and that you have good work ethic."
"1944","Really try and master OOP, DS, Algorithms.

Be comfortable in plain SQL. Select, Insert, joins, upserts, subqueries... 

Know a language fairly well.
Have projects demonstrating good fundamentals of OOP, DS, Algos.


Bonus points, learn a framework complementing the language you're good in and demonstrate comfort in that framework. Build a demonstration showing off that you know it.

How to interview: keep going back to your small projects when answring questions. Lean on it, as it's the only real experience you have.

Once you've got all the above, I would prep for interviews. Grind leetcode so you can pass OOP, DS, Algos. Yeah people hate it, but only morons would deny it's the primary filter for hiring. Don't waste the few opportunities you have to get an in person interview by blowing a coding assessment. Be smart and maximize your on-sites where you can lean on your projects."
"1945","Why didnt anybody mention the typical 150 leetcode mediums? Without those its impossible to measure how qualified for the job you are."
"1946","Did you do on campus interviews, did you do any internships?"
"1947","Algorithms and data structures. The rest can be taught."
"1948","Different employers expect different things.

Me, I just want someone who's friendly, ready to learn, not horrified by mistakes, and reasonably humble."
"1949","I hope I find someone like you when the time comes for me to start job hunting. Honestly, some of the stuff people have listed in this thread as requirements for entry level (excluding the people that are obviously joking/exaggerating) is still too much for me. Seriously, if these are the minimum requirements for entry level I'm likely fucked.

Then again, I'm not locating near silicon valley (I'm in Michigan) and I don't hope to work at a big N. Not that I wouldn't like to, I just don't think I'll ever be that good. And if I am ever that good, it would be after years of experience at another job which I'd have to land first.

Things of concern in this thread:

* Design Patterns (vague statement, what does it even mean to know design patterns? There's 20+ of them in the Gang of Four book and hundreds of other ones like MVVM, MVC, JavaDAO, etc. Unreasonable request for entry level devs imo)
* Mastery of DS &amp; A (vague statement to begin with as there's hundreds or even thousands of well-known ones. Also, to me mastery implies being able to implement them yourself. Seems unreasonable unless you're trying for Google or something) To be clear, I think it's reasonable to expect a basic understanding of the fundamental data structures and algorithms such as binary search, stacks, queues, trees, arrays, lists, hash maps / hash tables, etc. But not mastery, just the basics of when to use them and SOME of the advantages / disadvantages of each.
* Git/GitHub basics being listed to include things like rebase and merge. I think it's reasonable to require a basic understanding of Version Control, but I don't think basic includes things like rebasing and merging. Basic to me is init, commit, push, pull, add, remove, commit messages, create a repository, clone a repository and configure your username / password.
* I think it's reasonable to expect a basic knowledge of SQL and databases, but asking for things like upserts (which I've never even heard of after obtaining an AAS in CS, using SQL in Java, C#, and taking an SQL CLEP class for BSCS) is unreasonable and some joins is even pushing the boundary between intermediate and basic imo. Basic to me is SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE TABLE, CREATE DATABASE, DROP TABLE, PRIMARY KEY, basic conditions such as WHERE statement and basic concepts like subqueries.

I think it's reasonable to expect entry level devs to have a GitHub account with some very basic personal projects on it, for code samples if nothing else.

It's also worth mentioning that I was definitely one of the best and most knowledgeable people in every class I took throughout my CS program at my local CC, so I think companies are going to be hard-pressed to find people to meet most of the requirements in this thread if they're truly entry level. Obviously you're getting this from the perspective of an unemployed CS student from a non-ivy league college, but I have been programming for about four years and most of what I'm reading in this thread scares the shit out of me."
"1950","Personally I would not be able to just read that design patterns book and be able to say in good faith that I know those patterns. Knowing the patterns to me means being able to implement them, not just knowing that they exist. That would take a lot of time and practice in addition to reading the book, at least for me.

Also it was not my intention to brag. I attended a no-name community college so it's not like doing well there means anything. I said that to illustrate the point that, if I'm among the top of my class and, by this sub's standards I'm not even fit for entry level, where are employers going to find these magical ""entry level"" candidates that are experts in everything?"
"1951","They look for enthusiasm.

They look for the willingness to learn new things and the ability to learn fast. 

And finally they expect you to be able to solve well-defined problems, e.g: translate this mock into front-end code, write some code to implement a certain feature that's already well defined with certain tickets. This is opposed to more senior roles where they expect you to take more ownership and also solve more ambiguous problems like ""make the app perform better""."
"1952","You should definitely be looking now, it's never too early. I started applications the fall before I graduated and landed my offer a whole 7 months prior to graduation. I know my company as well as others dish out its offers early, so it's best to be on top of it"
"1953","Classical CS education from a good university. Good grades, and/or enthusiasm for the studies. Decent grasp of theoretical cs concepts.

Ideally some mastery of ""missing semester"" skills. Can actually take an off-the-shelf PC and use it to make software.

"1954","Anyone who answered some shit like abstract classes should probably stay in academia or their weird job that is different from everyone else.

The real answer: They want you to rush out projects that are presentable. They don't care if its useful or documented well because management doesn't even know what the word documentation means unless there's a definition of it in their slide notes."
"1955","OOP is good but mostly a willingness to learn with a good attitude and a willingness to do bitch work at a time imo"
"1956","As a new grad most companies aren't going to expect you to know it all.  When I'm interviewing someone that's new out of school or only has a year or two of experience these are some of the things I look for:

* Communicate well: be honest, humble and don't bullshit.  Most of the people that will interview you have been doing this longer than you and can see through your bullshit a mile away.
* Be enthusiastic.  There is a crap ton going on in software and IT.  Read, learn and be able to talk about something that's going on that excites you.  I always ask folks, 'What's new that you are into?'.  I honestly don't care what it is I just want to see a person be pumped up about something and take the effort to learn more.
* For whatever you are applying for understand the basics.  If it's a front end developer, do the introduction for React and build a couple of apps.  Be able to communicate that you understand the basic concepts.  As a beginner no one excepts you to know it all.  Being  able to talk the basics, and well, goes a long way for a new grad. 
* Some of the deeper concepts you learned in school may not apply initially.  Chances are no one is going to quiz you on OOP.  They are going to ask you questions on NodeJS or Python.  Understand what you are applying for and focus on that (see previous bullet)
* Good luck and keep your chin up.  First job is the hardest but you'll get there!"
"1957","Here's an answer some people in the sub won't like:

Companies (usually) aren't hiring computer scientists. They're hiring developers. The best developers aren't writing whiz bang code, pushing their languages to their limits, with code that's optimized to the gills.

They write code that is easy to maintain, easy to extend, and are mindful and knowledgeable of the business their code supports. Knowing how to be a better developer is great, but means nothing if you know nothing of the business you work in. Scott Adam (creator of Dilbert) says it best:


""If you want an average successful life, it doesnt take much planning. Just stay out of trouble, go to school, and apply for jobs you might like. But if you want something extraordinary, you have two paths:

1. Become the best at one specific thing.
2. Become very good (top 25%) at two or more things.

The first strategy is difficult to the point of near impossibility. Few people will ever play in the NBA or make a platinum album. I dont recommend anyone even try.

The second strategy is fairly easy...""

In the world of software engineering, this probably rings more true than any other field of work. If you work in finance, pick up books on finance. If you work in ag, pick up books on agriculture. Be an SME on what you work on. Don't live in a bubble."
"1958","Communication skills as others have mentioned.

For programming languages, Python, JAVA, and JavaScript are tops.

For software, AWS is huge.

"1959","Ability to learn, do various tasks you probably wouldn't think of being expected of (helping out the QA team with various tasks, maybe manual validation, helping DevOps with various tasks to understand the automation pipeline), showing initiative.

As an entry-level employee, you won't be doing any design, architecture and maybe not even much development at all at first. You'll be doing testing, automated testing to understand the product and how it works and what can be improved.

If you show enough initiative, you'll get more responsibility and some development work as seniors and management gauge your ability. My first job started off at QA (mostly automated testing, writing my own scripts), then the architect realized I could be way more useful going right into development work. But that was only because I developed tools to make the automated process more efficient (showed initiative)."

"1973","No dude this is crazy. Being fat has nothing to do with your development skills."
"1974","Well, it assumes that everyone wants to be healthy, which is not necessarily true. But that brings up question whether you want to hire someone who doesnt care about their health."
"1975","Skills, no. Energy and focus, yeah. Speaking as a recently not as fat fatty"
"1976","Yeah but to not hire someone because someone is fat says a lot more about the interviewer than the interviewee. And that argument is a slippery slope logical fallacy."
"1977","Gabe Newell"
"1978","I think people get confused when they hear people talk about soft skills. You don't need to be some charming smooth talker that wins a room over without effort. It simply means maintain the bare minimum level of communication that a functioning adult should have. 

As someone that had really bad social anxiety (and still do in large social gathering type situations), I overcame a lot of issues after years of having to interface directly with customers. It does take practice, but it is something that you can work on. People can go on and on about how to endlessly grind algorithms yet somehow think social graces are some innate trait that you're born with or not."
"1979","well put, i see a lot of people thinking this stuff can't be practiced or learned, that's definitely false. some people are born with an innate affinity for being social, sure, but at the end of the day it is literally just another skill, a skill that can be honed and improved and perfected."
"1980","Well, no, I really didn't have the skills at all. I couldn't talk to family members let alone strangers. I was really quite shy even into young adulthood (20-21). This is not the social anxiety, simply a better picture of my great communication skills. 

The point of this isn't ""I have X, if and only if you have X, you'll be fine too!""  It's more just emphasizing that social skills are learnable / growable. Obviously it may be more challenging for some than others."
"1981","That is the best way to do it. When I went to college I was super awkward. I applied to be an RA, for the free housing. Having to interact with people has taken me further in my career than my mediocre technical skills ever will."
"1982","You may ace the technical portion of the interview, but if you don't have the soft skills, nobody will *want* to work with you. Therefore, getting the job is much less likely to happen.

Totally agree with the importance of soft skills!"
"1983","Yeah no thanks.

You may be able to work with them. But can you speak for everyone else? Or is your team just 2 people?"
"1984","This person has bad soft skills."
"1985","There's a difference between being able to work with someone and it being pleasant/efficient.

If someone has horrible technical communication, for instance - sure, I will eventually be able to pull the relevant information out of them. But it might take an hour, involve a lot of red herrings that make it harder for me to remember the important bits, and I might not come away with a complete picture since I'm asking the questions - unknown unknowns. A good technical communicator can summarize the same problem for me in 10 minutes."
"1986","Thats objectively untrue. The classic examples are things like explain recursion to someone who isnt technical. You can understand a concept and still suck at putting yourself in another persons shoes and figuring out what analogies work.

You can also understand a concept and be really bad at organizing communication in general.

Youre basically saying that public speaking and technical skills are one and the same, which is obviously wrong."
"1987","Lol. A non technical person has no clue what a function is. You literally just proved my point."
"1988","Lol this logic is so bad"
"1989","This comment is definitive proof you dont have good people skills."
"1990","I consider myself to have good soft skills. That means I am totally happy to work with someone that does not like making small talk with coworkers, or with someone with bad posture, or that does not look me in the eyes when talking to me. 

I do not, however, want to work with 

- people that are perpetually late
- people that smell bad
- people that can't admit when they're wrong
- people that are rude
- people that can't communicate their ideas

"1998","No. Its not about making small talk or not, its about extreme social awkwardness that usually determines rudeness, complex of inferiority/superiority and so on and people are forced to tolerate this attitude (because hey, we dont have enough people in this field in general and cant afford to reject ones for the reason of soft skills). 

Being able to communicate, to establish a decent relationship with coworkers, to give a basic presentation in front of a few people or to work in teams without freaking out is essential in every job. 

Its wrong on so many levels to encourage people to stay like that and to promote this field as being the heaven for socially inept persons. Those aspies can very well learn basic social skills with good therapy and practice, given the fact that they are not retards and can acquire soft skills just as they do with technical skills. As far as I know, nothing related to their medical condition (if they even have one) stops them from having a normal life. 

Yes, I understand they are introvert people in this world who will never be social butterflies, but thats not the point. Many programmers are simply very difficult to work with and its sad. Imagine youre a junior in a company and you need help or an explanation or you just want to ask a question about your work and you meet this awkward programmer who doesnt even want to listen to you or talks to you like youre a shit or cant explain a simple thing without freaking out. Why do you want to encourage this?

Its about being a decent human being, not about whether someone likes to make small talk or not."

"2004","I dont really get the comparison either, but maybe hes alluding to Tyson being arrogant/ a douchebag. Meanwhile Terry Tao is awesome, collaborating with as many people as he can, blogging all the time and answering emails"
"2005","I meant it that, if you've ever seen an interview with Tao, even though he's nice, he's incredibly socially awkward, whereas NDT is extremely sociable."
"2006","Tao is the most collaborative mathematician since erdos, and far more intelligent than Tyson... though he may be more sociable in interviews"
"2007","I agree, and I think Terrence Tao was a bad choice for this comparison. In fact, Terrence Tao demonstrates that as long as you are sincere, show interest in other peoples ideas, and put thought into communicating clearly, then it doesnt really matter how you dress or if youre a little bit awkward. I dislike the focus on shallow soft skills in this post (e.g. your posture). Stuff like that doesnt matter (at least in tech) as long as you are polite and have something interesting to say."
"2008","So, who do you think would get picked to lead projects or testify before the Senate on the value of STEM R&amp;D funding?"
"2009","Again soft skills are super important; however, the best candidates have both good soft skills AND good technical skills. For the most competitive jobs, one is not enough."
"2010","for more senior roles soft skills are way more important than technical skills, eg for a role which has a lot more collaboration between teams, multiple people, leadership, technical skills fade into the background"
"2011","Technical Skill are overemphasized because they are overvalued. I see companies hire folks who aren't at communicating, into upper level management/architect positions. It happens quite a bit. When you make it past the interview stage, it ain't all sunshine past that."
"2012","If any companies actually did require Einstein level technical skills, I bet they would be a lot more flexible on lacking soft skills. But it seems like they don't really have too much pressure to innovate-they already have lots of power and money and just need to keep the cogs running."
"2013","The problem with soft skills is you don't get a precise feedback.

"2014","On the other hand, you fit right in this industry if you have autistic qualities. Many people have agreed on that."
"2015","You don't need to be super social to get ahead.

Soft skills are more about being professional."
"2016","100% agree with this, and I use it to highlight who I am on Linkedin. My whole bio is geared towards selling that not only do I have top-notch technical skills, but also amazing people skills.   


In an industry like ours where being good at socializing is a rarity, it can really give you an edge to get ahead. You'll find you get more opportunities (in a healthy organization) to do what you want, to attend special training or travel events, and people are more likely to want you on their team. All this inevitably gets you more experience and more ""buzz"" around you as an engineer. Around review time, you should see huge benefits.   


I have been lucky enough last year to have my team lead be so impressed with me that he wrote an email to my manager about my performance (highlighting how easy I am to work with as the first bullet!). My team lead doesn't even work at my company!   


I can't stress enough how important this stuff is."
"2017","Yes, so much this.
I live in Germany so interviews might be different. But when I compare mine to my friends (who is a little more introverted and more anxious in social situations) I absolutely see a huge difference even though he is way better codingwise than I am.

This shows in:
Me being called back literally the day after applying mostly, while he waits weeks for responses.

Me being offered a job / apprenticeship / training etc. again almost immediately after the interview (with the exception of one I usually got along super well with the interviewees and we laughed and joked a lot)
vs him waiting days to weeks for responses only to be invited to another interview (up to 4)

We applied to similar / the same companies for the same job / training too.

It's crazy."
"2018","If you're a Data Scientist/Data Analyst then to me, having the softer skills mean that you are just as skilled in; framing business problems, focusing on the end-user, communication of technical concepts, problem solving, and teamwork as you are in the latest tech and tools.

If you don't have those softer skills it can be difficult for you to turn the amazing tech work you do into some that can be understood and implemented by the business.  At the end of the day they're paying you to add value to the bottom line..."
"2019","I'm dreadfully failing in this area:  I was awarded my CS degree over eight years ago yet I'm 36 and never married."
"2020","Omg why are you telling them!"
"2021","You need to be competent in both technical skills and soft skills, seen candidates get rejected because they were weak in one of the two."
"2022","Yep, getting along with others is a valuable skill in every arena of life. No idea why anyone would think software engineering is immune from this. Getting along with your team will increase job satisfaction, promotions, work quality (you'll collaborate with people more) etc. NOT getting along with your team will get you fired."
"2023","I agree with you for the most part. A few which seemed odd or need clarification:

&gt; good standing/walking posture (shoulders back, seriously)

Most won't care if you aren't being super weird about it.

&gt;dress well

To an extent, but again, most people won't care within reason. I've worn jeans to interviews at big tech companies. No need to dress up in a suit or something. But don't walk in with an old tshirt and flip flops.

&gt;firm handshake,

I don't think anyone cares.

Just be a decent human being and try to be likable. If you're the best developer ever, but no one wants to work with you, you probably won't get hired, and if you do, you probably won't last long."
"2024","by dress well, i don't mean suit up, i mean clean clothes that go with each other. also dressing in clothes that make you look good will make you more confident and perform better. same thing with point 1, the posture thing is not just for others, a good upright posture with your shoulders back will make yourself feel more confident."
"2025","Yes 100% agree. I should have been more clearer, I was trying to provide clarification, not disagree with you. Too many people confuse ""dressing well"" with wearing a suit.

I've seen plenty of people interview at big tech companies wearing a suit, and they stick out. You'd be surprised at how many people don't realize that you can also overdress."
"2026","You're just nitpicking man. You don't lose anything by doing any of the things you nitpicked, you only stand to gain."
"2027","I am realizing this is NOT the field for introverts that I was hoping it would be."
"2028","Please stop misusing the word ""introvert.""

Being an introvert means that you ""recharge"" through alone time and solitary hobbies. No more and no less. It doesn't mean being socially inept or getting a pass on developing your professional communication and leadership skills."
"2029","What in the world are you on about? People need to stop upvoting complete nonsense. You are certainly setting the bar high for a senior dev by making up some definition rather than doing 2 seconds of research. That may be one aspect of an SOME introverts but ""no more no less""?"
"2030","I'm an introvert myself.

My description is the [defining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion#Introversion) trait of an introvert. There are other traits which often coincide with introversion (like being shy and quiet, for example) but they are NOT necessary to the definition. Extroverts can also be shy and quiet.

I understand well that social interaction can be draining for introverts. My point is that that doesn't mean introverts can use that as an excuse to not develop their soft skills in ANY industry - not just this one."
"2031","It's more introvert-friendly than most, but you can't work within a company without interacting with other members of said company"
"2032","I used to think my lack of ability to communicate effectively was because I was an introvert. I still would consider myself an introvert, but I've learned how to function very well in social situations through exposure and learning how to process my emotions."
"2033","I haven't been on a date in 20 years though"
"2034","The importance of soft-skills is incredibly overblown.  First of all, no matter how many times you drill it into some people's heads, you can't change decades of low self-esteem and poor confidence by telling them to practice being sociable, not going to happen.  Secondly, the idea of practicing to be sociable is such an autistic thing to say.  I mean really.  This is not something you can grind like leetcode -- you either have it or you don't, and if you don't, well most people really don't care to be honest. You can go out to the club every day and try to meet new people, but that doesn't mean you'll become socially competent.  Social skills take literal years if not decades to develop and are often influenced by life experiences and upbringing.  

If you're socially awkward and have poor social skills, don't worry too much about it, but you do need to remember a couple things.  You do need to learn to speak up here and there, and you need to stand up for yourself.

I see too many comments on here where people don't like a co-worker, so they'll just make a Reddit thread or go straight to HR about something.  No one likes people like that.  If someone is making you upset or uncomfortable, say something -- politely of course."
"2035","I was a basement dweller with a long distance girlfriend for about 7 years of my life, my youth, up to the age of 19. I did not have any friends, was in my room all day and read / played video games. I literally couldnt do anything, from calling doctors, talking to my PARENTS or interacting with anyone even in school.

So I said fuck it, I dont want to be like that. And for the next 2 years I talked to everyone, practiced not scaring people away, learned what's funny and how to apply jokes and how to make people laugh, learned how to walk and talk.

Now my girlfriend says I am the most social and outgoing person she knows, I get along well with everyone I meet, have a bunch of good friends and enjoy social interaction. Cant believe I'd ever say the last part.

You can definitely practice and learn social skills. I did it myself, and if I, a literal slug basement dweller nerd did it, so can everyone else. Even if they need a therapist, so be it, thats why they exist, to help. Dont be ashamed to need other people."
"2036","It took you a few years though, which is what I was saying.  I'm not saying don't improve.  I'm saying, it's not like leetcode, where you can just keep practicing it in a couple months and then turn into a gigachad.  Behavior is something that takes years to develop, and I just think it's a lot of weight to put on new college grads who are reclusive and introverted on top of other stresses like practicing algorithms and coding.  

tldr; stay improving, but don't place too much stress on fixing your personality."
"2037","Yeah I don't really care about my co-workers posture or if they're making eye contact or their handshake (never shook any of my co-workers hands so far). Someone else making too much eye contact makes me super uncomfortable. I'm ok as long as the other person isn't an asshole."
"2038","this x100, jesus it's common sense. although i guess it's easier to say this when you've been on the other side of an interview and know how arbitrary the judgement can be."
"2039","The world is full of charming people who can't actually do much. Then there are those are do the grinding and get stuff done and don't waste time on a\*\*e licking. Smart employers choose a mix of both according to their needs."
"2040","Downvotes for truth. Dude I spent 3 hours in shit meetings yesterday with a bunch of people making way more $$$ than me. Took 20 minutes before we got to anything useful. Thankfully I work at home and sat there facepalming the whole time.

There are 100% ass lockers who dont get as much done as you. They get paid more then you. They talk shit talk but csnt back it up with anything. Things fail they point blame elsewhere.

Be honest be real and be clear. Dont BS. If you work a place with all the politics and BS games to play I am sorry. It sucks. Some companies aren't like that and they value truth honesty. Brutal honesty like hey this timeline needs to be 3x longer or we wont make it"
"2041","Heh. Bro I know my place. I grinded startup life for 5 years and sold out to a biggun. I led small teams there and completed our shit on time. Now I am 100% a nameless cog. I'm trying to milk that corporate shit for a while now. At some point I might step up to be a manager but not yet. 

Only 29 yrs old. got a fresh baby in the house. Work remotely full time, start work at 9 (ish) Stop at 4 cause nobody cares. If I have important shit to do I work hard. Half the time corporate planning is so bad I have 2 days of work to do in a two week sprint so I literally play indie games on my laptop all day and smoke weed"
"2042","Reddit isn't the most obvious place to detect this. But I am honest, clear communicator,  sociable, willing to help. I've mentored 15+ people of all shapes and sizes over a 6 year span while also doing my own work. I am always laser focused and dont live with my stupid jira sprint agile blinders on."
"2043","Lmao OP you imbecile, nobody cares how good your ""manners"" are if you can't answer a simple trapping rain problem. 

Get back to grinding leetcode."
"2044","if you apply to the IT department of a random small-mid size company doing old school unstructured interviews then yes, you can get by with soft skills alone. if you're already a decent dev and you want to move up the org chart then again, you need soft skills. but most managers would pick the strong coder over the social butterfly any day if they had to pick one"
"2045","LOL."
"2046","We 100% care about soft skills when interviewing candidates. FANGs *especially* have specific soft skills (e.g., Amazon's leadership principles) that candidates are evaluated against to pass onsites."
"2047","You're trolling, right...?

I help evaluate soft skills for multiple job roles and have definitely rejected candidates who lacked these skills."
"2048","You'll never know whether a candidate has other offers. You also don't know how the candidate performed in other interviews.

When all the individual feedback is looked at on the whole it needs to show that the candidate has met the bar on each required dimension. I have never seen a candidate who absolutely bombed an entire dimension get through. Some version of ""soft skills"" (usually very specific skills you are asked to evaluate) is always a required dimension for every job role.

So yes, with that context, none of the candidates who've bombed soft skills have been extended an offer. But both bombing soft skills and nailing coding/system design/other technical skills is pretty rare. I've seen it a grand total of once (candidate was rejected, yes). If you bomb an area you're not qualified for the job, plain and simple."
"2049","I'm not going to dox myself. You're wrong and should listen to people who actually interview for the companies you talk about. There's plenty of folks on this sub willing to mention their place of employment. I'm not one of them."
"2050","Amazon cares so much about leadership principles lol. I've heard of many people failing for not answering those well. You know nothing kid."
"2051","Like everyone already said, you have no idea what you are talking about. You leave feedback on the candidate as a whole. Otherwise there is no reason to have an onsite at all, and they can solve a technical problem online without any human participation if everybody just cared about leetcode."
"2052","Everyone can tell that you don't actually participate in an interviewing process at a major software company. Feel free to type out novels though to convince yourself. I will reject an unlikeable candidate just because I don't want to work with them. My strong negative feedback will have a direct impact on them getting an offer. The health of the team is more important than individual technical skills."
"2053","My professor said when he started teaching a SAS based class, students had to help find solutions that had poor documentation lol"
"2054","Personal take: SAS has fine resources if you're the type of person who looks to documentation and technical support for solutions. It has *terrible* resources if you're the type of person who googles questions looking for a Stack Exchange post."
"2055","Definite agree on the learning curve part. The learning curve on SAS is very steep, especially if you're like me and get thrown into a project using it without ever having used it before. There are tons of little things that don't behave as you'd expect coming from other languages where you can make mistakes. (I'm looking at you, `LAG` &gt;.&gt;) 

I haven't gotten to the point that I can say I'm more efficient at doing anything in SAS than alternative environments, though. Any efficiency in code is counteracted by my own inefficiency in changing my thinking to SAS's logic. I usually do a barebones extraction and then export as soon as feasible, so I'm by no means an expert."
"2056","Yeah id agree. I use SAS at work and i still google stuff (as i learnt other languages girst) i just know now to jump straight to the sources i suggested"
"2057","I absolutely agree. To add, it might be helpful to get ""credentials."" Try Coursera for beginner to advanced certificates on R, Python, SAS, and SQL offered by leading experts (both academic and industry). It likely won't be better than learning it yourself but at least you'll have something saying you have formal expertise. Good luck!"
"2058","SAS isnt as common (I think its primarily for healthcare now), thus its not as crucial to learn if you dont plan on ending up there. Initially, I didnt agree with what people here said about SASit was, after all, the easiest little language for me to pick up in school. But then I realized that most people here have had to learn it on the job or because classes required it (and didnt focus on it), while I was able to take a class in it essentially from the ground up. There is a University Edition available for you to use as a student (I think your college doesnt have to register or anything like that), otherwise you likely wont get very far trying to learn SAS on your own because of the cost to use the license.

In any case, the documentation available for SAS is fine 95% of the time. Its pretty accessible and everything you need is out there in easy-to-understand formats."
"2059","I agree with this wholeheartedly. I learned basic level languages at first in middle / high school but stuff really clicked when I took AP CS and learned core tenants of programming languages that are universal after that. Now when I interview data science folks I couldnt honestly care if they know Python v. R but whether they understand the fundamental programming concepts and statistical concepts they are seeking to implement."
"2060","When you interview, do you care how they learned R or python? Do you have a preference for self-taught versus code boot camp or university taught? What if they know neither R or python but they have good foundations in java and C?"
"2061","They don't care. But they do care what you have done with it. Courses,  home projects, research, work experience.  I would argue these in ascending order of importance."
"2062","Agreed. Id add a caveat that Id expect some work experience ideally the more senior the position. 

Honestly i was also self taught for all my languages with the exception of Java so I dont care as long as youre able to explain basic concepts. I.e. if you claim that you know SQL be ready how different joins work, group bys, and Cartesian products."
"2063","Use the website DATACAMP for r and sql."
"2064","R + Python is key"
"2065","Thank you."
"2066","I learned SAS and R on the job, but would not have gotten the job without having taken a class in C.  I would just take the basic programming classes available to you, in whatever language, then learn SAS/R or other language as needed."
"2067","I learned SAS and R while taking statistical methods and applied series time classes. For R there are more options outside academia, there's a series of classes from John Hopkins in coursera. With SAS you might want to look if there are any applied classes that work with the software.


The languages you will be required to learn depend on the industry, say SAS is required if you want to go into pharmaceutical/health related industry. For general data science statistics R, Python, SQL are required. For BI/data analyst they usually go for Python,SQL and Tableau knowledge. Some places still work heavily with Excel.

Look what the industry you want to go in is looking for and learn those skills. And, since you are in 1st year, keep updated on what employers want, which might change by the time you graduate."
"2068","I've learned many languages and frameworks over the past 45 years.   I say this all the time and I believe it firmly:   ""There is no substitute for sitting down and writing bad code"""
"2069","Sounds too important to forget"
"2070","I think /u/coffeecoffeecoffeee gave some really good advice and it's at the top for a reason, but I have a couple of points to add.

* Please, please, please focus on learning open source tools where available. The sooner we can ditch proprietary and non-free environments the better for everyone! Yes, this means ditching SAS. I learned numerical programming on Matlab and Mathematica, and spent a significant amount of personal time relearning things in R and Python that could've been spend better actually doing real work.
* Just to reiterate - I am advocating you ignore proprietary platforms (SAS, Matlab, etc) to benefit the broader numerical computing community. You may wish to learn some of them if required, but the trend of using them in many fields is diminishing quickly.
* The level of programming skills you learn in your coursework is likely to be minimal to moderate at best. Start to learn some git and post your personal and course code to github.
* Find packages that you like/use on github and browse their layouts to better learn how to structure your own code. Honestly, this is one of the biggest things that you most likely won't find in your coursework. It's super helpful for other people if you structure your code in a way that is similar to how most people do it in whatever language you choose.
* Use those intro CS classes to get an idea of things to implement in other languages.
* Look at all the languages at your disposal: As an aspiring statistician I'd look at R, Python, Javascript, Julia, and maybe learning a bit of C, C++, Java, or Fortran depending on if you think you might get into the heavier computational side of things. Choose 1 or 2 and try to really get a handle on them.
* Find something you're interested in implementing in whatever languages you really find yourself jiving with.
* Things like SQL (or at least language-specific interfaces to it), tabular data interfaces (dataframes in R, pandas in Python, etc), plotting libraries, etc will start to come more naturally once you've gotten a decent handle on the base languages you find yourself liking."
"2071","I'm not a statistician - more of a data scientist or even data engineer - but my undergrad degree was in math. In my experience, almost every employer expects you to have SQL and may even give you explicit tests on it. Other tools are more variable; some employers will require them to get the job while others are willing to teach you.

I learned SQL from Stanford's online Introduction to Databases and highly recommend it. The material was well-presented, and I wouldn't have the job I have now without having taken that course."
"2072","SQL is better for general employment and marketability. 

Learn SAS if you want to get your foot in the door for one of those specialize fields that uses SAS. Mostly because no one wants to spend the time or license fees to teach anyone SAS. It is a bit of a catch-22. 

That being said, SAS shops are often desperate for SAS programmers."
"2073","SAS I learned through a job, but basically self taught (""here's the manuals"", he said, pointing to three full shelves of books, ""get to it"").  
SQL I learned in a programming class on databases (both that and SAS I learned in the 80s).  
R I taught myself in the late 90s/early 2000s.  

That's not even a fifth of the languages / packages I learned for statistics though. For a good while there I was learning about two a year."
"2074","SAS you basically HAVE to learn on the job, because it is expensive and the free online one is not very good and not really at all comparable to what the actual software is like. I mean, you can pay to do sas base programmer, but then you also need to buy the software. I am in the process of learning SAS for my job, and they paid for training and when I have an issue i just google it. I also was recommended ""the little book of SAS"".In my (limited) experience, when employers have expensive, specialized software like SAS or SAP, they are willing to teach you on the job and usually have a training budget. When employers use a free, open source software like R, it is more likely that they will want you to have those skills or will want you to learn it without paying for training. 

SQL I am also in the process of learning via udemy course, and R i am in the process of learning via coursera. So for me the only real way to learn has been to have to do something and then google and try things until i find the solution. That being said, a certificate program or diploma from a college could be good too."
"2075","I am a data analyst with a degree in Economics: SQL is a prime driver and the other are very great toppings on the cake. Have a solid SQL background, I used Udemy.com and took a course for a small fee ($20). They have you run through the examples as you go along. I Use R when needed (wish I had time to get stronger). Basically every company will use its own programs but if youre strong at a particular language and it brings value to the company, request to have it (Up to them depending on price). 
Once youre comfortable using SQL or R or any language.. create small fake subsets of data and practice with that. Practice makes perfect!! 

Be the person who can solve the problem when requested on the spot. (Provided the complexity)

SQL: These will be your best friends

(Case Statements, Aggregations, joins)

Know these and youll be in great shape!!"
"2076","I learned SAS during my Masters program. I dont have a stats undergrad or Id have been exposed to it there first. Now my program also teaches the MS students in R as well as SAS."
"2077","All online.

For SQL, I just googled how to create a database and worked on building my own data base, creating tables, and just trying to make sense of it all. I think this is one of the best projects to do to learn SQL. Youll get an appreciation for some of the basics of a database administrator (which makes you a more tolerable coworker!) and youll understand more of the ins and outs of how databases work. PostgreSQL has a nice and free open source platform, so Id start with something like that. Just google stuff like:
- How to stand up PostgreSQL database
- How to query SQL

I dont use R, I use python. I used code academy and datacamp."
"2078","when somebody pay me to learn, speaking as someone who didn't take a single course in the languages you mentioned nor a course in stats &amp; prob but like you took math in undergrad (then went on to do a phd in algebra). btw, you should add python."
"2079","I had done programming classes in java and c#, and wasn't introduced to R until I entered my degree (math). I already had a decent grasp of OOP and data structures, so it wasn't the hardest transition. But, when I got my first job I realized I was crap at R in the grand scheme of things and forced myself to solve work problems in R, even if it could be simply done in Excel or SQL. For me, the biggest help to learning it was to apply it to current work problems regardless of it necessity."
"2080","In R/python, I tried to pick-up a new skill every week by forcing myself to do a work task by coding. I learned shiny, OCR, and many neat tricks in data viz just thru that.

Also, whenever i pick up a new stats concept, I always look up an R package and try to understand how it works."
"2081","datacamp and only datacamp."
"2082","I minored in CS."
"2083","Learned R in my Stats courses, Matlab and STATA in a course but never used it, Python from Udemy, SQL from YouTube, Excel from idk."
"2084","Several classes in SAS and R.  For resources, Little SAS Book, Applied Survival Analysis Using R, and Survival Analysis Using SAS were good books I used to reference code."
"2085","Did a minor in computer science back in the day, got exposed to Pascal, C/C++, FORTRAN, LISP, Java (blech), Basic, some assembly language... Going to R from C is a breeze. SAS is a dinosaur and a pain, but with a bit of practice you get a hang of the basics. SQL can be a bit of a pain if you try to do funky operations, but the basics of data querying and manipulations don't take long to figure out, as long as your data is fairly simple. I keep meaning to do more Python but every time I get nasty surprises. Still, programming languages are like piano: practice, practice, practice, that's the best way to get better at it.

Still, some computer science theory on algorithm and some math do help in figuring things out regardless of the programming language paradigm."

"2092","For me the only real gap was getting to grips with the huge existing codebase, and how it all fit together

I don't sit around applying Djikstra's algorithm all day, but knowing how the underlying theory is working did definitely help me get on board with the work much faster

Also, in my degree we really focused on Java, and I've never used it in my job. However that deep dive has made it WAY easier to get into other languages since you can very much see parallels between them"
"2093","Working with big code bases is the one thing I really wish I had learned in school.  My SWE classes exposed us to things like architecture, testing, code smells, devops, all that extra stuff we do that isn't directly writing application logic.  But when every assignment is doable in under 500 lines between 3 files it just doesn't click.  It took about 6 months of FTE for me to finally grasp why that's important."
"2094","This is funny because in the last year Ive found Djikstras was a great solution to our problems on 3 different occasions. Formulating problems as graphs is great if you can manage it."

Met with about 10-15 internal managers about what their teams were doing, someone eventually introduced me to who would become my manager on the moonshot team. 

I made it pretty clear I was interested in the product/challenge. They were looking for experimental idea-oriented people who are more interested in being flexible and fast than perfect and planned, which was right up my alley."

*  communication with clients or users

* trying to anticipate side effects

* the stress of putting something in production that have a high impact on users

* the complexity of databases and codebases in businesses, especially when they're quite old, the technical dept is high and legacy code is hard to deal with

And yeah PRs... many ways to do something but then your implementation gets murdered/reworked before gets merged ah... and the testing man with Jasmine/Mocha and Selenium ahhhhhh I used to just be a coder back then now it's like more ""logistics"" than coding and progress is slow story's have time allotments of 160hrs+ usually like crazy.

"2108","CI and CD is automated builds and tests, when you merge something on the master, you run a tool that does every step necessary to deploy. For a website it might be doing installing vendors, installing assets, clearing caches, etc. Everything that you'd do by hand to update your application is done automatically

CI is more about automated tests and CD about releasing updates

At work we have tests, security checks and linters running when we commit to a branch and the build will fail if something doesn't pass. Then once your branch is good, you push it to the branch, launch a build on Jenkins,which fetches the source, builds everything, creates a new directory on the server and finally creates a symbolic link on the latest release (we keep 5 releases) 

TBH I'm not good at it and other people in the team are managing it, but you still have to understand how it works."
"2109","Continuous integration really just means that various tests are run regularly. Continuous deployment is the same thing for releases. Often there'll be automatic deployment to a test environment and then people will pick good releases to go to prod.

CI helps catch bugs fast. Often you'd automatically run tests for every change or PR or the likes, which can catch bugs before they're even merged in (and thus impacting others). However, CI only works if you have good tests.

Docker and Kubernetes are unrelated. Docker is a container system for making deployment and building easier. Particularly, it helps avoid the ""it works on my machine"" issue by abstracting away from your OS and hardware (but being lighter weight than a VM). K8s is a way to deploy containers, especially to make it easy to scale them and have them interact with each other."
"2110","You may not be using all that theory in your day to day, but being informed as to how things work in the underlying system and understanding why things are designed in certain ways is invaluable.

For some more directly transferrable skills, try learning how to work in a team environment (possibly using agile or some other methodology), try to touch a wide range of topics and tools, and most importantly learn how to learn effectively. A company hiring a new grad isn't going to expect them to be immediately useful, but being able to pick things up quickly will be a god-send."
"2111","100% the truth. I started a month ago and once I started asking questions that required a higher level of understanding my tech lead seemed a lot more relaxed about having me on the team. School just teaches you how to learn, then you must take those skills into the real world. The amount of business logic at an enterprise level is ridiculous."

"2116","it means business specific parts of the code. for example say your company needs to transfer a file from a remote server N number of times a day and each transfer needs to have a time stamp attached along with a uuid or something to that affect. how you implement this/architect it is entirely up to you, however the business logic of what needs to happen has already been determined. hope that helps."
"2117","let's say you are Screenflix, a hypothetical streaming subscription company. What is the core purpose of Screenflix as a business? To deliver content to customers and keep them glued to the screens. 

Business logic: CDN, Edge caching, data-mining and ML in addition to the regular signup, sign on, watch flows. 

Not business logic: reinventing the telco-scale networking devices (unless proven to be a bottleneck)


So business logic is the part of software/engineering that fills the gaps between existing solutions brought to market."
"2118","Business logic is / are the constraints and processes that a business uses to accomplish its goals.

To contrast business logic against system logic I would make this distinction: you typically cannot Google business logic. You will Google the mechanics or implementation details of it, but you can almost never Google business logic, because that is all about stakeholders."
"2119","can you give an example of a new thing to learn? like a new programming language?"
"2120","Everything is a new thing to learn:

* New languages
* New codebases (where things are, how they interact, why they're designed that way)
* New tools (build systems, bug systems, telemetry, logs analysis, debuggers, on and on)
* Accessibility (and how it works with every new toolchain you interact with)
* Localization (and how it works with every new toolchain you interact with)
* World Readiness
* Estimating the cost of work
* Who the essential people to know/interact with are (subject matter experts, people who are reliable)
* How to interact with other teams productively
* Who your users are
* What your users currently use your product for and want to use your product for
* Who your competition is and what they're doing

And on and on and on.  Every day you will be learning new things."
"2121","This is a great point. Every single job I've had involved learning something new, whether it's a new language, a new source control system, new libraries, new testing frameworks, even new operating systems. There are things that people now take for granted (cloud stuff - AWS, GCP, and container infrastructure like docker/kubernetes) that I actually struggled to learn after having 20 years of software dev experience. I only recently started truly understanding git.

Learning some of that stuff actually got in the way of me being able to do my job. I'd ask another dev for help and they'd tell me what to do and it sounded like gibbrish. I said ""alright, just tell me what commands to type"". So I'd spend my evenings studying up on all of the various technologies that I didn't understand, which is humbling for someone with multiple decades of experience in a staff-level role. On the other hand, I know my limits and have no problems asking a junior dev for help if they've been at the company longer than me."
"2122","Any tips for learning new codebases? I feel like I barely make any progress staring at some massive git repo and trying to piece it together."
"2123","Step 1: Check documentation and see if someone else has already written down a guide.  If so, read that.

Break it down into smaller pieces and start somewhere (exactly where doesn't really matter).  This can be significantly helped by a good code search tool or IDE that can index the codebase and take you to the definition of symbols.

If the codebase is structured well, this shouldn't be crazy - start looking at a file (tracing interesting functions or codepaths outside the file as necessary), then a directory, and so on.  You don't need to look at every file or know every bit of functionality, but having a map of the major components is very useful.

....and then go write it down so the next person doesn't have to duplicate your work."
"2124","If it's an open source project, just pick an issue and try to fix it.

That way, you're going in with a specific goal as well as some keywords you can use to locate the problem area. If you *do* end up figuring it out then you can create a PR and give back to the community, which also helps build soft skills that are very analogous to ones you'd use in a professional environment.  

Even if the issue is too complex to make progress on, it at least gives you a reason and some guidance to tinker with a large codebase. Hell, just figuring out how to build such a project locally can be a feat on its own, and you'll learn a lot while doing it."
"2125","Clone the whole repo, get it in your IDE and compile it yourself.  Once you get that working, start at the entry point, go line by line, and click through to definitions to see how everything is working.  Use actual business logic software, not just a library (unless you just want to see how certain functions are implemented).

You could run the software and find something arbitrary to change, even just text strings or prompts, or expand and add your own commands."
"2126","Ive seen seniors introduce patterns that Junior devs won't implement because they're not used to it and don't know it well. They would rather do something they're comfortable with to get the job done quicker rather than learn something new. 

For example, a senior will use the strategy pattern where as a junior dev would rather use a nested if else statement on a type check instead of taking the up front time to learn and understand the design pattern. This makes all the difference in maintainable scalable code.

Whether someone is actually capable of learning new things and trusting that they'll take the time to do something right is besides the point. An education is hard evidence that they're more willing to learn and not cut corners. It makes employers more confident in long term investments."
"2127","My experience has been the opposite. Senior developers reluctant to use new patterns. At Big N."
"2128","Cool"
"2129","Yeah, I think it's pretty generalizable. You need a strategy to get people to adopt new ideas."
"2130","I'm literally going through this and this will help me push further."
"2131","Gonna hint that in my next job interview"
"2132","Theres a guy on our team who teaches university level discrete math. He lives and dies by theory/underlying principles"
"2133","I loved discrete math as a student, now I want to retake it as an engineer and see if I can better understand application."
"2134","Agreed. I was worried when I got out of college, since then I found most companies I've worked with weren't too much worried on how much theory I knew.

The biggest thing I have learned from dev field is you need to be able to communicate and work as a team. There have been guys hired who were more qualified than me, but they could not communicate and just read the room when explaining their solutions for a problem with the team. There have been so many times where two people were ""arguing"" about how to solve a problem, when they were actually saying the exact same thing and I would have to step in and get them to realize they were on the same page.

Or we have had coders where they think they know everything and will just keep quiet and code away, when they didn't bring it to the team to see if it made sense. So after they have spent two days coding and we reviewed the code, they were super defensive and upset.

Keep the mentality of your code you write is going to suck in the beginning, don't take it personally when someone reviews your code and tells you where you went wrong. You are part of a development team, just learn from it and keep coding away. There have been guys who have code way longer than I've been alive and I still find problems in their code from time to time."
"2135","I agree working on a team environment is essential and not taught in school, but theres no way a bunch of students are going to effectively use agile for anything really."
"2136","I've been a software engineer for 10 years. I started in the C++ world writing windows applications and now I'm in the web world building websites and writing APIs. Here's a few things I can say:

* I have never, once, had to write a sorting algorithm.
* I have never had to balance a binary tree.
* BigO is cool to know, and talk about, but it's not as prevalent as school makes it seem (outside of interviews).

Almost every CS/SE job boils down to one thing: How do you get data from point A to point B."
"2137","It's a shame how true this is yet every company wants to grill pretending like they do it, which they probably don't. The craziest thing to me is even if a sorting algorithm is written, it will be written once and copied many more times, whether internally or on SO/Wikipedia. 

I think bigO is important just to know that you can't write 4 loops within loops unless you absolutely must, and look for chances to write recursive functions."
"2138","Of course, there are some optimization tricks like tail-end recursion, but it completely defeats the point of using recursion in the first place because it basically mimics iteration. Just because recursive solutions are simpler doesn't necessarily mean they're efficient when run by the computer. You don't use recursion for the sake of recursion. You use it when you have no other choice."
"2139","Oh interesting, I thought many of them are nlogn and better than n^2 that people normally would do."
"2140","You can get away with suboptimal solutions in most of the easy to medium leetcode problems, but not for the hard ones, and hence why simple recursive solutions won't work."
"2141","Aren't there some languages built around being recursive. It might be more fair to have this caution for recursion in an OO language"
"2142","Big O is very relevant for me and I use it most days.  I find it most useful when I can switch out a DS and get massive runtime gains (order n to constant time)"
"2143","I dont think I stated that point as clearly as I could have. BigO is important in the sense that you need to know not to nest a whole bunch of loops.

However, the way colleges teach it, you'd think your boss would be coming up to you during every code review and asking you to figure out the notation for every algorithm.

BigO is more a way of teaching students rules which they should know by feel later on. For example, I can look at some code and know it's inefficient without calculating the bigO and comparing it to my new code."
"2144","Exactly. No one is coming by my desk to ask for the runtime analysis, but it's still important to know."
"2145","I imagine things like run time and latency are important in finance or embedded programming, no? 

Disclaimer: I am a student who is curious about this because those are fields I'm interested in. So I'm not trying to be snarky or anything."
"2146","Thank you for the resource. It explained the issue very clearly."
"2147","No one is asking for the big O of every algorithm you write. But if you write inefficient algorithms, you can expect the reviewers to point it out with a mention of big O. And most certainly you're expected to be able to calculate it in your head so that you don't write such algorithms in the first place.

It's actually one of the more relevant optimizations because scalability can be so important for many applications these days."
"2148","Its in the name. Computer *science*. Engineering is different. CS isnt supposed to teach you real world stuff, its to teach you the theory. If you want a job youll need to learn real world stuff yourself. 

If only they explained this to every single person applying for CS instead of going on about how it gets you the job as long as you know your DS&amp;A. No. Skills gets you the jobs. And that requires much more than just going through a CS degree."
"2149","I like this response the best. There are hundreds of thousands of Jr Devs with no degree. The skills required for a job have only some overlap with a CS degree."
"2150","This is why I'm switching my major from CS to software engineering. The engineering department focuses on real-world skills and actively practices team development, code reviews, etc. My CS department is too much of ""do this and do that and done"", kinda like RPG missions."
"2151","Im a Product Manager and I always appreciate new hires who come from an SE background over a CS one. They are MUCH more useful in the workplace and generally ramp up quicker. Their dev manager and I dont have to spend as much time coaching or correcting SEs.

Im glad you mentioned business writing - that, interpersonal communication, and basic SE skills like proper source control usage, code commenting, usage existing libraries &amp; design patterns, and being adaptable around legacy code are all things that make a huge difference."
"2152","SE is not a degree offered at many good cs schools...so I dont see why you prefer SEs. The best coders in the world all mostly have CS degrees and math/physics/other engineering degrees of anything else."
"2153","Most businesses don't need a supergenius pro hacker from MIT. Most businesses just need someone to build them products that their customers will pay them money for. That requires some basic level of technical skill, but after that basic threshold is met there's significant diminishing returns for increased technical skill compared to increased ability to do operations work and to communicate with other business units and so on."
"2154","If that's your thinking then you're losing out on potential talent on CS peeps"
"2155","what is the difference between SWE and CS in terms of course work really?"
"2156","Agreed I would love to see a curriculum so I could address any gaps"
"2157","Here's a term by term breakdown of University of Waterloo's Software Engineering program: http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/ENG-Software-Engineering

And here's their degree requirements for Computer Science: http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/MATH-Bachelor-of-Computer-Science-1

There's also even more theory focused versions of the CS degree, like the BMath in CS, but these two I listed are the big ones there. You'll note that software engineering at UW has lot more hardware and engineering fundamentals focus, while CS has a lot more math, and freedom in choice of specialization.

Edit: missing word"
"2158","I thought i was familiar with the requirements of CS but that looks very different than what my degree requires interesting. I wonder how much can be chalked up to difference between the US and the EU. Thank you for sharing these resources."
"2159","What do the requirements look like in your experience?"
"2160","I think I over-exaggerated the differences on the first look because I didn't see a lot of those classes were a ""pick one of two""  type situation. I would say the biggest difference is I have to take 3 different algorithm classes."
"2161","I am a senior at a pretty highly ranked CS school in the US, and while I am graduating as a Statistics/Applied Math major, I didn't decide until recently so I was taking the CS and Math curriculum at the same time. We had an introductory DSA class, a computational probability class, a discrete math class, and an advanced algorithms class as core requirements with an upper level requirement to take either Formal Language Theory or Combinatorics + Graph Theory. My buddies at other schools in the US doing CS degrees all have very similar requirements.

Then we have electives, where you can either take practical stuff like Web Programming or Computer Architecture or theory like Numerical Computing or our AI class (which is all theory).

The example above was from Waterloo, which is in Canada, so maybe they have a slightly different curriculum.

So the US CS curriculum might be more similar to yours than you realize."
"2162","Waterloo is in Canada, so it's not quite the same as a US computer science curriculum."
"2163","I did my undergrad in Computer Science and Engineering in 2010 from a south Asian university then completed my master's in CS from a Canadian University. What I personally feel from my experience that followings are the mandatory courses in CS and SWE apart from hardware courses:Programming Courses, Discrete Mathematics, Data Structure, Algorithms, Automata, Compiler, OS, Database, SW Basics with Design Patterns, Computer Architecture and basics of assembly language, Basics of AI, Basics of Networking."
"2164","Not to sound cynical, but pretty much everything. 

Computer science is a science, its theoretical by nature. Software development is very hands-on and practical. Id say that design patterns and some algorithms and data structures is useful though  

Big differences are:
- source control (such as git)
- writing tests and leveraging test frameworks
- designing code into maintainable modules
- depending on the language and application type youll almost certainly be using a framework and API youre not familiar with
- databases, being able to use a database through code. Being proficient enough with SQL to work on existing systems, and troubleshoot any issues with production. 
- delivery models such as agile. 

I find that theoretically CS gives you a foundation in computing and how you might design a system, but real world experience builds upon that very quickly once you enter the workforce."
"2165","My CS degree program had courses that touched on all these a little. The main issue in my current job is that our codebase was (and is) written and maintained by a series of amateurs who were (at times) over their heads. No testing, version control, modular design, formal development stages, etc. I'm trying to show them the light while being a good junior dev and not step on toes; thankfully they recognize their lack of formal knowledge and defer to me on those points."
"2166","you have to use two \ns to separate lines even in a list"
"2167","Yea virtually everything lmao. It's true"
"2168","Having a strong foundation in the theoretical will help you in the long run, it can elevate your potential to become not just a software engineer, but a good software engineer. Armed with knowledge, you just need to gain experience in order to reach that potential. 

There's a difference between a code monkey and a developer.

I would always encourage people to complete their education, before heading to the workforce. (Unless you have special circumstances preventing you from doing so, eg. Finances, life event, etc.)

Edit: I entered the workforce as a junior web developer 9 years ago, and now I am in a leadership position supporting over 50 web developers."
"2169","Is it because of efficiency of code?"
"2170","Efficiency, code design, system architecture, understanding the underlying technologies, learning how stuff works.

It does mean during your education, you really spread out and learn as much as you can.

For example, I took courses on database systems, networking, compiler design. I ended up becoming a web developer. These topics on the surface, don't look like they have too much in common with HTML, CSS, JavaScript... right?  But in reality web sites and web apps require databases and internet to become useful because we have to deploy them somewhere. Understanding these neighboring concepts helps give us a more holistic view of the system... how everything works together; it leads to better, more resilient, application in the end and you're better equipped to support the application when it runs into issues. 

For example, when the webapp seemingly randomly experiences connection issues... your team is stumped because they don't see anything in the code that could cause it. So you  dig through the server logs and see this ""database error"". You then look at the backend code to trace down to the line where it tries to interact with the DB. You don't see anything weird there either. You trace more logs and realize that it happens to different services randomly, so it's not always the same backend service experiencing problems. You end up eventually pulling up all the different classes that are accessing the DB and realize some of them are actually trying to modify the same tables and the actual culprit was a database lock. 

If you hadn't taken any courses on databases, you may not have recognized the symptoms as database lock, and provide solutions on how to fix it.

And even though I mentioned compilers design course, that's just usually one of the hardest CS courses offered. The professor defines an imaginary programming language and asks the students to write an actual compiler for it. To pass the course he runs different snippets of code into your compiler to see if it's works. If you can survive that course, you'll probably have a strong grasp of understanding how programming languages and syntax are processed by the compiler and what's actually happening under-the-hood, and with enough coding chops to implement a compiler itself.

The main point is, finish school, really challenge yourself, push those limits on learning as much as you can, and on many different aspects. Having a good breadth of knowledge as well as depth in the topics that are important for the career path that you have in mind. That way, you enter the workforce better equipped to take on any challenge they throw at you, at that point, it's simply focusing on getting experience. Same concept applies at work too, challenge yourself, go above and beyond, help others out when you see them struggling. Skies the limit."
"2171","1:  Dealing with existing tech debt. The biggest roadblocks for me so far have always been dealing with some unexpected tech debt/bug in the system. 

2: Dealing with business logic. The hardest part of my job at a fintech company is learning all of this financial terminology/knowledge I knew absolutely nothing about before I picked up the job and figuring out how to apply it correctly.

I already knew source control, unit testing, agile, web frameworks.. I used all of this extensively in school projects."
"2172","I'm also on the same boat. Except I can vouch for `bisect`. It is a really powerful tool to have when you're chasing a bug that you know was not there before. It saves time, but more importantly mental workload and gives you peace of mind that no matter how weird the bug is, if you're sure it was not there before, you're gonna find it."
"2173","Merge-base is definitely quite niche, bisect will be used more often when dedugging to find which commit the bug was introduced."
"2174","Merge-base I use the least for sure, but still listed it because coming to understand it will rid you of overly simplistic thinking about git commit history.

I still struggle with wanting to ask questions like this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3161204/how-to-find-the-nearest-parent-of-a-git-branch"
"2175","Nonsense, for git all you need is cherry-pick, reset --hard, reset HEAD~, clean -f -d, and checkout (-b)

then again youre in austria so Im not sure how any of this works since your git trees are upside down"
"2176","I've never even seen these commands on any ""teach yourself git"" tutorials."
"2177","Rebase and reset are all you actually need from this list."
"2178","I feel like 'knowing git' is a bit overrated in this sub. Having a very high level understanding is really sufficient. I would say most teams that Ive worked on have a mix of engineers who know git very well and those who know just enough move code around. 

Just depends on the job."
"2179","At my college I learned: database design, maintenance, optimization, implementation and management. server-side architectures and systems design. 

I also learned Interface design and front end/UX best practices.  

Not in any of my classes did they teach us to connect the front end and backend, or how to work with the system as a whole. Granted Im from a no-name college where they take anyone. 

I guess I feel like I never got the big picture. We were always working on building parts of the system, never building the system itself.

Ah well, at least I got the piece of paper..."
"2180","This actually seems like a more practical curriculum than most. At my college the core included data structures, algorithms, discrete math and systems programming. The database class was an elective and mostly focused on the underlying implementation. Never learnt anything remotely related to software engineering."
"2181","Did u go to a polytech by any chance? I go to one we sort of do what you do but we study ds&amp;a and system design. At the end we make our own system. Ours is a clothing store for kids."
"2182","Hi, no I went to an obscure liberal arts college in Vermont...virtually nobody outside of Vermont has heard of it, but it did have an accredited CS program."
"2183","Yeah, that totally different then"
"2184","1. Git.
2. Testing.
3. Writing maintainable, well-designed code.

"2186","Rest apis and other patterns"
"2187","Classes didn't teach me shit about testing. I ended up using JUnit and Mockito much more than I expected, and before I left school I only heard about the first one.

Usually I end up writing a happy case as a kind-of documentation for the next guy, and some cases which fail in exactly one way."
"2188","tempted to downvote for mentioning junit and mockito but making no mention of spring/hibernate"
"2189","Y'all didn't use Spring and Hibernate at school?

Boy, did we have different curriculums."
"2190","did you go to a school in freedom land? if so I assume it was a tech school or in some tech area

Im pretty much every other university, no - spring/etc. are not covered at all"
"2191","No, Europe. We had a end-of-year 2 semester long project to do, and we were highly advised to use it, because that's what the industry uses too."
"2192","OK in freedom colleges its not used anywhere

senior projects are done on a LAMP stack lmao"
"2193","Also, it's not like we had a class titled ""Spring and Hibernate 101"". 

It's just that advisors told us - if you're doing web things in Java, use Spring and you'll have a heads-up on any job interview. So everyone did. Mostly self-taught, cause web dev in Spring is not rocket science."
"2194","I remember someone used nodejs instead of php and everyone went wild"
"2195","Specific frameworks like those aren't good examples since things you'll work with in school will entirely depend on the language you happen to be writing in.

But that said, yeah, it's weird to me how many things people claim aren't taught to them in schools. Git is the big one. And to have not used *any* framework ever? Like yeah, CS is focused on theory, but not a single class in four years of study that goes over practical manners? Not a single project class where you make some real program? And here I had multiple such classes."
"2196","With all due respect, in principle - yes, but in practice - Java and Spring ain't going to go away anytime soon."
"2197","Of course. But there's so many options anyway and my experience with web frameworks is that it's not usually hard to learn one once you know another and fundamentals of full stack dev. I've actually never personally used Spring (though am aware of it). I've used .NET MVC, the Play Framework, Flask, PHP frameworks that I don't even remember, and Go with its native http and template packages. They all came pretty easy after the first one."
"2198","I agree with OP that the knowledge is required, but that doesn't mean you need a CS degree to get that knowledge. Like you I've worked with a brilliant software engineer who has good fundamental CS knowledge and never went to college."
"2199","So then what makes a good candidate? If you think the degree doesn't allow us to learn on the job more quickly and be effective in the field then why even look for it?"
"2200","The biggest gaps I noticed when I got out of school and into the workforce were these

- knowledge and experience with version control, beyond basic functionality

- my SQL proficiency

- the intuition on when to ask for help. don't spin your wheels too long on a single thing, but also don't ask for help right off the bat.

- my ability to communicate technical concepts to people who do not have the same technical background.

Edit: also managing dependencies on large scale applications and learning how to use dependency graphs to make sense of dependency hell."
"2201","It's easy to look into the theoretical side and think that it'll all be useless but I think part of the goal for many people in CS is to eventually be in a job where it's not useless and very applicable. Those jobs do exist, although rarely, and you won't be able to do them if you aren't familiar with stuff like big-O and algorithm design. That's why companies screen for those tasks so heavily; if you do happen to pick up a task like that they can't have you just bodge it cause you've never heard of those skills. 

On the flip side the skill that I wasn't taught formally in my degree that has become by far the most useful is project planning. By that I mean the ability to take a full feature request and break it into the steps of gathering requirements, planning an architecture, breaking that into tasks, and implementing it. 

This is much more easily learned in internships. I had 2 that specifically just gave me a feature to work through those steps on for the entire internship, and that's the kind of internship experience you should expect at any of the places everybody wants to work.

Being able to architect entire features is what employers will look for to give promotions and is the best way to impress as a junior dev. If you're already past the point of getting out of school and hired you can start improving that now by doing things like participating in planning meetings or in architecture notes online at work."
"2202","Junior dev here, 2 months salaried bootcamp, 6 months of professional work. I'd say everything, I learn far more practical skills in the past 8 months than in 5 years of college (excluding skills I taught myself).

My CS education was 80% theoretical, 20% practical and even those practical education was mostly useless because they were mostly either outdated technologies or bad practice.

I mean back in college web development as taught to us was all about writing .php files with notepad++ and copying it into XAMPP folder, along with using mysql managed by phpmyadmin. Back end codes, html, javascript, all mixed together. No REST, no N-Tier architecture, no unit testing or even breakpoint debugging. Why? Because we don't know better as we were taught by out of touch people who knows fuck all about how it's actually done in the industry.

The only useful skill I remember learning was about projects documents (BRD, etc.) and SQL, because SQL is timeless. But they were nothing that Indian youtubers in a 480p youtube videos can't teach better."
"2203","This is the tech equivalent of ""Why do schools teach calculus instead of *real world* skills like how to do your taxes?"".

But to answer your question, it's true that a lot of it actually isn't directly applicable to your future job. However, the theoretical concepts you learn are still valuable in that they teach you different ways of thinking and help you become a better problem solver overall."
"2204","Landed an apprenticeship last year that led to a full time junior position starting in Jan for 70k starting. 

If I had only what my classes taught me, I wouldn't have even been considered. Nearly all of what I learned to get that job was information that I taught myself outside of class doing various projects or courses. I have a friend who was sadly unable to get a job after college (though he's young and has time) that did nothing outside of coursework and is very upset about the situation and is very under-qualified last I spoke to him, saying that he wouldn't have had a clue of what to do when I explained to him what kind of project I had to do and turn into my workplace as part of the selection process.

Don't short yourself in the foot and waste a lot of money by *only* doing classwork. A lot of recruiters in my area would not consider graduates with nothing on their resume but a degree. 


Personally my system was really bad at teaching contemporary frameworks for the languages they taught and only covered either basic or old ways of doing things. If I were to give advise it would be to one start a project in something that interests you and two focus on learning the most popular frameworks for your favorite language"
"2205","Source control.

Everything else is better off learned through work experience. Processes and tools differ vastly by company. 

Learning how to use some type of source control will keep your senior mentor from wanting to bang their brain against his desk till they hear sloshing sounds"
"2206","It depends. Do you want to work as a researcher or a dev? Researchers often have to use theory for coming up with better solutions to problems and they often have to come up with theoretical proofs for their work(you can refer to blockchain scalability research papers by NUS under Prof. Saxena)."
"2207","Many things. I was unemployed for 4 months, but 3 months ago I landed a role as a junior full-stack developer. I think the problem is more that technology changes so fast that it can be difficult to develop curricula that meets the needs of the software industry.

As a front-end/fullstack developer, the main things I missed were the following - **JavaScript** (it's everywhere in software, I graduated without writing any vanilla, plain JavaScript), **distributed systems** and **database architecture**, and cloud computing (**AWS** and **Google Cloud/Firestore**). I use these technologies on a daily basis. Thank God I knew React and iOS/Android by the time I graduated because I now have a better sense of frontend principles. I then learned more front-endy things on the job like Sass and wireframing.

Here's a project oriented indicator of your skillset - you should be able to build a performant system that solves a real world business problem. Make something you're interested in. 

For example, make a gradebook application for teachers. Write the frontend in JavaScript, and the API in Firestore or AWS. Create a login system that takes a username and password and logs a user into a restricted area only logged in users can see. Then create a frontend application that allows people to type in grades. Log changes to the gradebook in a message queue which then batch writes to the database. Then, have the database write to another frontend application targeted for administrators, parents and students that displays individual student calculated grades. There's a ton of data movement in this for a relatively straightforward system of managing student grades."
"2208","What do you use firestore for?"
"2209","When I was writing a game in React Native, I had to make simple API calls to a database in Firestore. If a person got a high score I would record it along with their username. This required me to know how to set up the tables and do data validation."

"2213","Learn how to read code and figure out what it does, and then modify it. Chances are you're not going to be working on something from the ground up as a junior right away. If you can't read code, figure out how it works, and start playing around with it, you'll be behind."
"2214","The most helpful thing for me in having practical experience in actual software development is simply to get more experience in actual software development. It sounds obvious, but it's true. Do an internship before you graduate. Work on personal projects. You can try and learn specific technologies, but odds are that when you get your job you'll have to learn something completely different. (The extent of that being true depends on your own experiences. I'm currently working at a company that's infamous for having an almost entirely proprietary tech stack, but YMMV.) The skills that are useful anywhere include working on a team and getting big, complicated projects done. Everything else is more or less details that you will often be learning as you go."
"2215","I know you are specifically asking about hard skills, but what I really think is ignored in education is soft skills. I'd argue there are more necessary soft skills than hard ones and having an encyclopedic knowledge of hard skills is not important to anyone.

"2216","How would you develop soft skills"
"2217","Study them, then practice them. It helps to first know what they are. If you can actually list the skills upon which you need to improve, you can create action items and identify opportunities to improve your behavior. Where you previously would shrug someone off, you can now mentor them. Where you previously would see something as not your problem, you can now take ownership. Where you previously would keep your head down and be input-in-code-out, you can now communicate better with management and your team. After doing them a few times, not only will you see the opportunities to do them more in the future and the benefits they had on your team and project, but you'll have answers to your inevitable behavioral interview questions."

Every now and then a problem will come up that they get me to come over and look at. It has been things like pass by reference/by value, not correctly instantiating an object before putting values into it, or problems with static objects. Sometimes data structures come up.

Those are all really basic things, but if you do not have a traditional CS background then you will have no idea how they work."

"2225","While you won't use everything, I actually felt pretty prepared for my first job. Besides just picking up some new languages/technologies and the company-specific knowledge, which you have to do pretty much anywhere, the biggest gap for me was writing production quality code.

College code is overwhelmingly very hacky. You're working on projects, usually largely from scratch, at most in a small group, and usually over a relatively short period (eg a couple months) and then throwing it all away. Colleges rarely test for (or are able to test for) things like maintainability and scalability. There was definitely an adjustment going from ""let me write some hacky shit that works"" and ""I have to write a maintainable, scalable solution"".

As for things from college that were super useful in the workplace, I felt that databases and distributed systems and/or parallel computing were super, super useful. Topics like writing efficient queries, determining database query patterns and choosing appropriate indices, choosing appropriate database technologies, handling concurrent reads/writes, parallel data structures, data consistency, and parallelisation come up *all the time*."
"2226","I got a BS in MIS back in the DotCom era and started a software company where I specialized in custom business software.  What I found was that most of what I learned about programming didn't help nearly as much as I needed.

What really helped was doing real world projects.  After I did a few large projects, I realized the true value of the degree.

The same thing happens when you learn business from a book vs the real world.

In the real world, most everyone tries to screw you over, most everyone doesn't give a damn about your life and most everyone thinks they know everything about whatever they are talking about.  Most people will put in just enough effort to get a reward and nothing more.

This is usually reflected by how they treat their health, they put just enough work into their health to stay alive and nothing more.

If you really, really want real world skills, build a real world product that DOESN'T come from a tutorial.  Many ""programmers"" will search for a ready made solutions that they can download and compile and claim they built it.  It's a gray area because we all learn from some book or tutorial somewhere, but it's the difference of having to solve complex problems when the answer isn't in the back of the book."
"2227","Things I've noted as _helpful to know_ while in the first year of my job and internship:

* Database systems and SQL"
"2228","Ive been working for a company for 8 months now. I dont actually work for the IT department  it a department that has 2 Dev positions for managing the teams macros. 

In college we had required compiler, data structures and algorithms, computer architecture, and operating systems. I was going for computer science so I dont know how that lines up with your college path. The majority of the classes I listed dont have direct application to my day to day.

That being said understanding the things I learned in those courses help in the way I think about enhancing what I do in my day to day. Compiler has helped me in knowing I could set up a script that can auto write code that would follow a laid out template instead of having to write the code my self each time. DS and algorithms helps me in my thinking of how to setup my class structures and helped challenge my critical thinking.

The point being, tho the classes may seem more theoretical than practical, its helping your critical thinking and helps you to know what you are able to do and lead you to find more things. Knowledge is always power.

To answer your question, I would have appreciated a web dev and front end/GUI courses. All the projects we did were in terminal so the GUI was of no real concern. Im having to teach myself web dev concepts for a project Im pitching at work."

"2238","I did not major in computer science, but I took 3 programming classes and a few non-programming CS classes. The things that I wish I learned (or had time to take the class for) was the internet. I learned on Java and my first job was Java web development and that was the most confusing stuff ever because I only knew the internet as a user, I did not understand it as a programmer at all. I only created simple Java applications like Chess or practicing algorithms, so it was a huge shock. I did not fully understand promises or callbacks until a while into my second job. 

The other thing that I never got was the practical knowledge that every engineering job needs. Why in the world were we not taught git or some kind of version control? Why were we not given pair programming assignments? Why not give us an assignment in an existing repo that has a lot of code we should read and understand before starting? My first job has extensive training so I was ok with actual programming, but I knew nothing about how to work with people or write code as part of a team or anything. I felt like such an idiot at my first job.

A lot of this code won't have any documentation or comments so you need to learn how to work with it without breaking anything."
"2243","It's kind of like the difference between studying civil engineering and then actually working on building or maintaining a building (or set of buildings -- aka systems).

In CS coursework there's lots of different concepts, most of them abstract, and they kind of come and go; you read a chapter, do some problems/implement a project, get tested on it, then move on to the next one.

&amp;#x200B;

When working in the real world though, there's a set of patterns that emerge for most software projects.  How's logging done?  How is test data generated?  How do the unit and integration tests work?  What are the networking components?  What are the persistence components?  What are the messaging components?  How are builds done and artifacts captured?  What are the specs/use cases?  For the most part, you can break down any project into different discrete questions, and as long as the software/system is well built, you can dive into any specific area and get started pretty easily.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd say the most important technical skill in the workplace is to be able to figure out how something works (ie without any documentation, or with just straight up incorrect documentation); a big difference between a ""10xer"" and a mediocre engineer is that when the latter will throw his/her hands up when something doesn't make sense, the former will keep asking and answering questions until he/she figures out the root cause -- usually by going below the application and figuring out how to log/debug an application's dependencies (said at 11:20pm on a Tuesday:  ""Oh! The http library tries to send a TLS1.3 request even though it only supports up to TLSv1.2.  It silently fails during the handshake.  How dumb; I should let the maintainers know"").  If you can do this, you'll be valuable anywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm curious about what material you are dubious about.  It's true, most of the material you'll learn in college won't be useful all the time on the job, but if (more like when) something comes up and you bs'ed your curriculum, at best you'll look inexperienced and at worst you'll look underqualified (he/she has a college degree and doesn't know what a digital signature is?).  If you do it right, you'll already be experienced by the time you graduate.  Then, when a senior engineer says something like:

""yeah, we use a custom transport protocol for internal service calls to XYZ; yeah it's kinda dumb but it saves network bandwidth bc the link is spotty on the intranet.  Anyway, it's UDP with a custom retry handler, the code is in the 'com.arvent.internal.app.net.client.retry'.  Why don't you take a look and let me know if you have questions""

you'll be like ""okay, it's kinda weird but makes sense.  Maybe we should refactor that in the future"" instead of ""what??  What is UDP?? Que es transport layer?? Dang, I didn't study anything in college because I didn't think it would be useful!?!?  Maybe it actually \*is\* better that the university gatekeeps  curriculum instead of me, since the university knows almost everything about the relevant areas of research in Computer Science and I -- some random schmuck that was born 20-something years ago -- know nothing!  Now I have to spend the next week and weekend reading up on computer networking and writing some ditzy, hacky solution that will get torn apart during code review instead of making love to my gf and playing fortnite.  NOOOOOOO""

&amp;#x200B;

I was being kind of a dick but yeah, if you study hard it'll pay off bc the best/senior engineers all know the stuff you're studying, and have applied it so that the software/apps they write are better than naive implementations of solutions in their respective technical domain.  That's if you're working for a company with proficient engineers.  If not, you'll have to BE the best/senior engineer and implement it all yourself, as well as create a POC, schedule a meeting (on lync or some equivalently shitty corp app) with the team leads, manager, and some business people, and show how much the new implementation kicks ass when compared to the current shitty naive implementation.  It's more work, but if/when you do this, everyone will look at you like you're god.  Pretty cool, esp if you're young.  Anyway, those are my souped-up-on-coffee-saturday-morning thoughts/ramble.

"2244","For me it was process and paperwork, everything aside from coding that goes into a project with hundreds of devs on it."
"2245","I remember back when I was a senior and I did an internship, I started stressing over just how important being able to learn specific technologies was. I didn't understand how to approach learning a framework, or a new devops tech or... well, really anything at a high level of abstraction because I had gotten so used to staring at everything as low-down as possible.   


That and best practices. But, those come with experience..  


My advice would be to make an ACTUAL product using a modern stack in your chosen technologies. It doesn't have to be big or complicated, just something you can show and say ""I learn this myself"". It shows that you're capable of picking things up and also gives you a head start on technology.  


As CS people, we come out of school with a really great foundational understanding, but very little applied knowledge.  So, showing you're ready to pick up tech used in the real world is pretty important.   


So if you're a Java guy for instance, maybe make a simple project using Spring Boot for an API, with a detached UI written in a Javascript framework. Honestly, if you can figure just that part out, that's huge. Separating a backend from a frontend is the common practice for new web-based software. That immediately puts you in the lead of junior devs.   


If you're lower down, do an embedded project with some arduinos or something to automate a real-world process (even if it's pretty contrived).   


If you're a data guy, make an NLP or CV model or something. Or do an ETL project with Spark or something like that.  


There's a lot of other tech you can get your hands on and play with, like Docker &amp; Kubernetes and CICD tools and such. But, honestly, that's reaching pretty far as you won't even understand why those tools exist until you see software development in the wild.  


  
If you don't want to work alone on a project built from scratch, look into some open-source stuff. There's tons and tons of projects that need contributors, so even if you can just fix bugs and write tests, you could get your hands dirty on a real project that's used by the industry."

"2247","One thing Ive learned in CS that I apply at the start of every task is the concept of completeness. In CS 170 you do proofs and you have to logically assert that 100% of edge cases must be covered. All that practice really does prepare you for creating new features and data schemes because youve been trained to catch all the angles and think big enough to make a tech plan to cover everything. It also helps with thinking about edge cases to test your code. Operating systems has also come in handy a few times, permissions and all that."
"2248","I think the theoretical stuff is where you gain the most understanding of how to write good code honestly. I understand that a front end dev probably does not need to know the intricacies of  how things like an operating system work, but a lot of people shipping code dont just write stuff for the web.
I dont think it is ever a bad thing to learn more about computers if you are going to be shipping code. My education, seemed to have prepare me relatively well for a job as an engineer and it was really theoretical."

"2254","I honestly felt like beyond data structures &amp; algorithms, computer organization, and two electives in databases and software engineering, most of my coursework was not useful for work. Most beyond that was in more abstract theory, which isn't bad to know.. but I can't say it has helped me directly or indirectly whatsoever.

I would say a good skill to have is simply being able to learn things on your own/know how to use your resources efficiently. In a lot of jobs you'll be learning a new language, framework, etc. You'll be expected to solve problems on your own (to some extent), and I know too many new grads who expect to be hand held through every error message and cant read documentation.

Also just common sense clean code and DRY practices. I worked on way too many senior projects in school with people who would still rewrite the same code in several places without considering generalization, and do x, y variable names. Modularity is also good."

just on a much higher scale, but dont stress it"
"2257","I'm not sure if I count as jr or not after 5 years but I can speak to this a bit. Their were two large gaps that existed for me specifically.

1. Database classes weren't a mandatory in my program, so I had to pick up all my database skills quickly and on the fly. Not incredibly difficult but it would have been nice to have more structured exposure to it in my degree. This is also a fault of my own having actively taken other CS elective over it. I wouldn't really trade anything I did take, so I wish I just had the time for the extra class I suppose.
2. Most of your work will be learning 3rd party libraries and frameworks. This again isn't incredibly difficult, but it would have been nice to be exposed to that reality in college, perhaps with assignments required the usage of some list of third party libraries.

Edit:

Bonus round. Learn GIT or some other version control. One more quick and easy, but knowing it right off the bat will be nice. Also experiment with IDE's. You won't always have a choice in what you use, so it's night be somewhat familiar with everything that's a fairly big player."
"2258","To me it was knowing all the pieces, but not really knowing how to make a puzzle yet.  

Or like knowing all the letters in the alphabet, maybe even some words, but now you have to write a book or be a poet.  

To me it takes time and experience no matter how smart you are in college."

"2260","From my college days: 

1. Version control. We didn't have free stuff like git back then, but it is something you certainly need to learn today.

2. Using whatever tools you have at hand. This one is a bit difficult to explain, but in college we were forced to reinvent the wheel every time we wrote code. Rarely did we get to use any libraries or frameworks, and had to write everything from scratch, for the purpose of learning. 

This kinda ingrained a mentality that you'd need to roll out your own code for everything, and using libs etc. felt like ""cheating"". This one actually stuck with me for a long time. 

3. Logistics of software. Deployment, upgrades / maintenance, management, etc."
"2261","You'll be surprised by the theoretical CS stuff that *does* pop up in your day to day life as a software engineer."
"2262","Version control is the biggest thing missing from school usually.  Git, svn, whatever."
"2263","I will say that one thing you notice when you start going through your career that a lot of the picky details you learn in CS \*only\* come up in interviews. ""Can you explain polymorphism? What's the difference between an interface and an abstract class?"" These things don't ever become important in the actual job. Only in the interviews."
"2264","Source control, version control, and how to do a code review.  You will spend much of your professional life on these things, and none of them are taught in college."
"2265","Permissions levels."
"2266","In my case, doing everything at the same time rather than focusing on some aspects. 
Speaking with clients and at ceremonies.
Also the amount of edge cases to consider when working on something real. Lack of deeper education on front end technologies. 
Every design choice will need maintenance."
"2267","git"
"2268","Problem decomposition and transforming its subsequent endless solutions into some form of code that does it's best to resemble SOLID."
"2269","Corporate politics and how that plays out. I've yet to see programming ability make a huge difference. 

If anything, tone back the fancy stuff. If you write an interpreter to solve a problem, someone else has to maintain it."
"2270","You're not asking me, but one of the big ones I find that shocks folks new to the industry is the requirement o support other people's code. 

I get them into interviews and ask, ""can you support this code base"" and the response is ""I can write it from scratch!""  

Sure... but that' wasn't the question.  Learning to work with code someone else wrote is 10x harder.  Writing code that someone else can support is 20x."
"2271","not a junior dev, also don't have a CS degree, but here's my opinion wrt practicality:

the best employers in the industry care about the theory, and the knowledge -- you'll need them to pass the interview process

they do not care about the degree itself, at all (once you get an interview, that is)

soo, you should still consider it as being relevant to the real world due to its importance when it comes to interviewing, even if you never, ever use it on the job itself.

but you can also take into account the fact that not learning something now means you won't be able to learn it later. you just have more spare time to dedicate now, which makes it easier. if you learn it now, forget all of it, and interview somewhere a year or 2 from now, relearning will be easier than learning from scratch"
"2272","I very much agree with the relearning part."
"2273","A lot of CS is just theory but most devs in the industry with a CS degree are honestly better than those without a CS degree.

Most relevant is DS&amp;A as lots of the work may be optimizing queries to speed things up which means you need to know how to code efficiently. 

CS classes also introduce you to harder coding exercises than you'd experience from things like Udemy or bootcamps. So a CS degree will usually prepare you better for more difficult challenges."
"2274","From my experience this isn't always the case. 

I worked on inhouse software that's used in a warehouse and by making the functions ran after a box is scanned perform quicker from around 6 seconds down to 2, productivity went up by over 30%. People were able to process their orders quickly.

This isn't big N either. Lots and lots of places are like this."
"2275","Once you get your first job you are pretty much being paid to learn. Few new grads are worth half what we pay them for the first 3-6 months.

If you're concerned about getting hired, just look at job postings for the company you want to work at. Then one by one learn about the technologies they list in the must have/desirable section on their job postings.

However, I wouldn't stress too hard. Work your ass off in school. Play less Minecraft/COD. Will be fine. If you don't get a good internship, think about doing some volunteer work. All of my friends that did volunteer work found real work within 3 months of graduating."
"2276","I credit my education with teaching the fundamentals and the mindset that allows me to do my job.

It didn't teach me direct job skills but the ability to learn, to understand the concepts of computing, data types, etc."

How can you be sure its solving big girl problems and not just........ banking (no offense banks). Is a start-up a good place to begin? Or a big tech company?

They pay better than similar jobs in academia, and they can open the door to full-time positions. The main role of CS (that I'm aware of) is to make climate scientists' models use supercomputers effectively."
"2284","If you could shut down all cryptomining you would do more to reduce global energy usage than anyone or any company has individually done so far.  With the probable exception of Ghengis Khan, and he did it by killing a lot of people (also, energy use wasn't a concern back then)."
"2285","Do you know of a good source to learn more about the energy use of cryptomining?"
"2286","Not off the top of my head, but look around and you'll find some.  On a small scale it's not that bad, but with mining now being as wide spread as it is, and the process being inefficient (by necessity), it ends up wasting a lot of energy.  
  
On it's own this isn't a death sentence to cryptomining, it's only as dirty as what creates the electricity for it, the issues would be drastically reduced if it were powered entirely off of green energy for example (hey, idea:  make crypto miners powered off of wind, solar, nuclear, and geothermal energy to offset their creation costs), but excess energy demand typically takes the dirtiest/cheapest energy sources because it's the easiest to bring to market."
"2287","Proof of stake algorithms were supposed to reduce the power waste problems from proof of work algorithms in mining (that give a preference to higher hashrate). But I have fell out of the crypto scene so I don't know if many of the major players have carried through with that conversion."
"2288","Right because it's crypto mining that is the cause of environmental issues, way back when the big bitcoin industry bought Congress in 2009."
"2289","There are multiple causes of environmental issues.  
  
Want another one?  Engineer a control system that makes a nuclear plant automatically shut down in the event of negligent maintenance.  
  
Nuclear is by far the cleanest and best energy source current technology allows for.  But, when it goes wrong it goes really wrong (despite that, it has the lowest deathprint per kwh produced).  And it only goes wrong when they're not maintained properly.  So create software that can't be bypassed that forces regulatory compliance."
"2290","This is a common misconception. Crypto mining seems like a ""waste"" at forst glance because it computes numbers for no apparant reason, however every hash makes the network that much more secure. Governments spend orders of magnitude more energy to keep their fiat currencies relevant."
"2291","Jesus fucking christ you guys really are a cult."
"2292","People that say it's a cult are a cult of its own. I find that usually they can't reason the value proposition of blockchain or explain what money and continuity are.

Not denying us blockchain people are diehards. Even then, naysayers are a thing too."

"2294","Lmao freedom fighters ok"
"2295","Assuming you're a student pursing a CS major, this is exactly the type of question your advisor is good at answering. They're probably better suited for it than 90% of this Reddit.

My anecdotally based advice is to get good with stats/data/data visualization. I have a friend who wound up working in some bio lab that does stuff related to environmental stability and fishing. He isn't exactly a researcher, but he does a ton of data related stuff for them, lots of visualization, interpretation, and analysis. He doubled majored with a BS in CS and stats, however almost everyone he works with has a PHD."
"2296","You can get into the software department at any biotech company"
"2297","Youll make a lot more impact by making a lot of money and donate most of them away."
"2298","Hi OP Im no expert I am a lost twenty year old in a CS major with the same hopes as you. My current plan is to do some half/half major between CS and chemistry and then go into a PhD program with my super slick CS skills and.... somehow help solve problems in polymers or batteries? Chemistry majors are well positioned to solve these problems imo. Not sure if my plan will work will update in thirty years."
"2299","Probably the best environmental impact you could have would be to make a commonly used program slightly more efficient and save that power from ever being used."
"2300","This is a good one, it's along the lines of what I was saying.  If you can do things that result in less power drain, in theory that should reduce environmental impact.  Though in practice, it might just lead to people using more power to take advantage of the excess that's available."
"2301","There are a lot of things you can do actually, just not directly. Iff you want to make environmental changes, think about software that take away jobs. 

Ex: Email reduce paper uses and # of secretary jobs, accounting softwares and E-Invoices reduces more paper uses, electric and automated cars reduce emissions and hopefully traffics. Maybe in the future we'll have self-driving electric buses and trucks to replace truckers. Think about all the video conferencing software like Teams, Slack, Zoom, etc... These allow people to work remotely/WFH and less people going to work means less people driving cars."
"2302","Government utilities type of jobs need CS people too. Unfortunately, for a lot of it, the work is glorified sys admin (with cooler end toys). So, get your sys admin and cybersecurity classes."
"2303","Be humble and patient enough to listen.

Recognize when your ego is bruised and you aren't thinking with integrity.

Don't gossip. Don't let others gossip.

Know how to give constructive feedback, especially to sensitive people. Giving praise goes hand in hand with giving constructive feedback.

Be comfortable both as a leader and a servant.

Learn how to debate.

Don't say things that aren't true.

At the most basic level you should be able to wish well for people. Love is important. If you aren't making decisions out of love, how are you choosing to make them?"
"2304","This is some of the most solid advice I've ever seen on this sub; good range, well expressed. Kudos"
"2305","I agree 100% with you, but these are not examples of interpersonal skills:

&gt; Things like coming to meetings prepared with a list of things to talk about/reach an agreement on, effectively composing what I have to say so that it's clearer to my teammates than the hitherto unorganized stream of consciousness, and breaking down the requirements before signing off on them are definitely things I previously neglected that I want to focus on this time around.

Those are example of being a more thoughtful and detail-oriented professional."
"2306","I like associating skills with the projects or work experience subsections to which they pertain. That gives the reader a timeframe in which they were used or learned, as well as the context."
"2307","Everyone here bad mouths them, but I'm a hiring manager and I like them. I don't think if you give yourself an arbitrary 9/10 or 10/10 that you're ACTUALLY that skilled at it, but I do use it as a means to easily identify which languages or skills you believe you're better at and which you know but aren't as proficient.  If someone has 3 programming languages listed with different ratings I don't even need to ask them which language I should ask them questions for. 

What I see about these which does annoy me when using these: 

* overly detailed scales (no ticks, but one looks to be 7/10, one 7.5/10, one 8/10 - far too granular)
* Everything is listed as highly rated
* Way too many things listed. Don't rate yourself on 30 different skills. Not even 10
* Soft skills rated. Not useful information really as they tend to be over stated. The one you link - 10/10 hardworking? Like really are you in the literal top 1% of performers when it comes to hardworking-ness? Or do you work really hard like everyone else? I roll my eyes when anyone gives themselves 10/10 on any soft skills. 
* Unsubstantiated claims - and this one drives me NUTS. Give yourself a 4/5 on Java? Fine, but I have to SEE in the rest of your resume where you have used Java and get a good idea from actual words how experienced you are from the rest of your resume. 

So if you really want to use them, do. I don't know of any hiring managers who would throw out your resume for having bars graphs. 

The alternate is to just leave it off, and let the text of your resume to speak for itself. Upon reading I should be able to see in your case for example that you used Java at a job 6 months ago but not at your most recent job. You can always clarify in the actual interview when it matters. Not every interviewer is going to ask, but I usually ask candidates to rate themselves informally or ask what their preferred language is, or what their experience is with a particular language before jumping in with more questions."
"2308","I find it too hard to evaluate my level at a language. I mostly do C++ and the more I program, the more I learn how much I don't know about that language. I've met a lot of other students who think they are good at C++ but have no idea what l and r values are, what metaprogramming is or what Boost is. I feel like someone with 10 years of experience in C++ would rate himself a 5/10 when someone with 1 year of experience would rate himself a 7/10."
"2309","Yup, and a person I was interviewing with was blown away when someone I was interviewing with 10 years of experience exclusively in Java rated himself as 7/10. The person interviewing with me questioned him, and he replied that well he certainly could know more about java compilers. 

Really, just about everyone rates them around 7/10. I've had interns rate themselves 7/10. It's kind of like the pain scale when you're at the hospital. When you walk in and say your pain is at a 7/10 that's not very important, but if later you're saying it's 10/10 worst pain you've ever had clearly you've gotten worse - the actual score is meaningless - it's the delta which matters. Java listed at 7/10. PHP listed at 5/10? Great I've learned something - not that you're 7/10 on Java but you know Java quite a bit better than PHP."
"2310","Honestly, i know this isn't answering your question, but my personal opinion, don't waste your time with platforms like Upwork or Fiverr. They're a race to the bottom, and you'll be competing against outsourcing firms who quote cheap prices and often deliveyr pretty crappy work. Work on your own projects, there's lots of examples of indie makers that make small websites that bring them in a decent amount of money from subscriptions, and concentrate on doing well in your career. 

Those platforms usually don't pay anywhere nearly as much as you can make if you manage to get a promotion or an offer from a Big-N or an investment bank. As a software developer, the best way to get paid more, is by getting promoted or a competing offer. 

This is all assuming you're in a country like the USA, UK, Australia, etc by the way. If you're in south east asia where salaries might be much lower, then yeah, Toptal, Fiverr, Upwork might all be ok. Toptal the better option."
"2311","This is solid advice thanks. I'm in the UK so luckily those options apply to me. Getting promotions and applying to Big-Ns is a good idea but I've just finished university and started a new job which I'm enjoying so far."
"2312","Ah ok, yeah i'm in the UK aswell. Then in all honesty, don't waste your time on Fiverr or Upwork. I tried it aswell at the start of my career and was a waste of time. But if you really want to do something part time give Toptal a go. Or just join a community like [wip.chat](https://wip.chat) or indie hackers and use those as motivation and support for your side projects."
"2313","I think most people either develop a project of their own hoping it turns profitable or go the freelance direction. I agree with the other comment upwork and fiver are traps. You might be able to find contract work on job boards or if you have any networking in tech this might be what the use it for. There's probably another subreddit specifically with advice on freelancing in general.."
"2314","And which subreddit is it?"
"2315","tutor lmaoo"
"2316","There are a few ways.

Offer to build websites for small businesses around your area. I mean as long as you don't charge them $1000 for a bootstrap page, they will most likely want to do it.

Make mobile apps, dude if you can somehow make vscode run on my iPad, I will pay you $30 for that app even if I have to manually compile it.

Build your own startup, this is a bit more difficult as you do need to find a founder, I do not recommend doing this alone. And to get any type of professional investment, you most likely have to work full-time for it, and your education/work background also matters quite a bit in this context.

There are many more: creating open-source tools and ask for a donation, make indie games, manage servers for people.

&amp;#x200B;

I would stay away from fiver and upwork, if you are in NA, the average pay is too low, you just can't compete."
"2317","Just self host a docker container running [Code-server ](https://github.com/cdr/code-server) on a pc then access the site on your iPad. Boom. Vscode on your ipad."
"2318","I am aware of that haha. I am talking more about a native app that utilizes iOS 13s new file system."
"2319","I used PPH when I was starting self teaching programming to force myself to use APIs and things I would never chose to use in my own projects. As others have said it was a race to the bottom but I was learning so was not treating it as a real source of income. Some of the clients I got stuck with me and I have a steady stream of jobs coming from some large companies. Not enough to quit my day job but a very nice bonus once in a while. 

People go on those sites to get things dead cheap but with that they dont get very good customer service (most of the time). I provided great customer service from the get go and was always contactable so when they came back for other jobs I could charge a more realistic price."
"2320","For me, projects are just popping out, all the time. Some are from friends that have software companies and sometimes need some consulting / freelance development and sometimes it's for direct clients that are looking for website for their businesses and somehow know me / some of my friends/family.

When I started in the industry (4-5 years ago), it was not like that, but with time passing I was making more and more contacts and I always made sure to mention that I am looking for more work (outside my regular job)."
"2321","Build a freemium plugin for an established platform.  E.g., Wordpress plugins."
"2322","I am making a small game on unity and trying to monetize it afterwards, it might fail but at least I have learned something. I feel like my scope is small enough for me to be able to finish it alone but I need outsource some textures etc"
"2323","PM me about the texture you need outsourced. I do digital art and 3D modeling as a hobby so I might be able to help out."
"2324","Development work is so weird. In a past life (not programming) I could easily apply my skill set outside of my day job and make more than I was in my 9-5. The trade off was that the 9-5 was steady and reliable income, the side work was usually too small for any legit company to take on, and it was inconsistent, but I could charge multiples of my wage for the jobs (best rate I negotiated was a flat fee that rounded out to $500/hr over 2 weekends). I just kept a steady balance of that stuff until I knew I would be changing careers and shifted my priorities. 

Programming, it seems, yields less money outside of a 9-5, no additional career development potential, and very little potential to turn that into a steady gig. Ive always had the OPs question too. 

Like, how can I go find some mom-n-pop level business and charge between $100-500/hr to do what amount to a few weekends worth of dev work, and isnt terribly far off from what Im already doing? Even my current boss recommends I consult, but the work isnt there. I guess its that for work that is a side hustle, the lack of commitment allows for remote work and global level competition. Instead of competing with people from my community Im competing with people living on a fraction of what I need just to pay my internet bill."
"2325","I didn't use any third party platforms whatsoever. I just asked around and went to networking events and tried to make connections the old fashioned way. Friends of friends of freinds, that kind of thing. Getting started was the hardest part, but once you have a portfolio you can reference and people to vouch for you then it isn't too hard. Half of the battle is just marketing/grinding. Making the website is the easy part normally."
"2326","Im young and have a lot of non-technical friends from school, friends-of-friends, etc. In particular, quite a few of my friends went to art school and they always seem to be needing help changing their sites around. I fairy regularly get contacted to assist with minor things like hosting, WP, website coding, zapier, etc. Every now and then Ill get a bigger project. None of this ever pays better than my full-time SWE position, but its extra cash, I usually learn something new and Im helping out people in my extended network."
"2327","I don't know why so many people get the impression that you can always earn money on the side using your programming skills.

Sure, some people do, but there's absolutely nothing unique about programmers in this regard. A industrial plumber could make money on the side by servicing residential clients. A tax accountant could make money on the side by setting up their own financial planning firm and working outside of business hours.

The honest truth is that it's really fucking hard to make money on the side of a full-time job, and most people that talk about talking to small business owners or monetising WordPress plug-ins say this because it's possible, not because they've actually done it themselves. The problem with chatting to small businesses and clients is that they often work in business hours (i.e. 8-6), and more often than not they want any service they're paying substantial money for to be performed in those hours.

As far as my experience goes, I had a very brief side gig transitioning broken WordPress builds over to the Umbraco CMS. A friend of mine reached out regarding a tailoring business he had set up, and asked me to help fix his website. Since it was a super basic CRUD site, I ported the template over to Umbraco and hooked everything up in a night. From there, I noticed that the original developer had left his watermark on other sites, and most of the time the site was broken in some obvious way - so I decided to message all of his old clients and ask if they wanted someone to do what I did for my friend, and many of them said yes.

I gave up because I initially wanted this to be a one-time thing, where I build a product and leave, but I found it hard to pawn people off to freelance friends of mine for new work. One person even offered to pay double to keep me instead of going to my (frankly, better) freelance buddy. The work itself was mind-numbingly boring, and it started to creep into my day job, where I would fend off emails during the day and spend most of my lunch break sneaking in calls/emails/code to satisfy an out-of-hours client. Most importantly, working a full stressful day, getting home at 6:30, and starting work all over again was hard, and refusing to say no to what seemed like easy money led me to hate writing code. In the end, I lucked out when a friend of mine went into contracting as I was about to throw in the towel, and I managed to gradually push everyone over to him.

All in all, I made some decent money, but it wasn't worth it. Looking back, I would've traded it all for those evenings free."
"2328","For programming, it will almost always be more efficient to increase your primary income over any type of side-gig.

Find a better paying job or get promoted. Both of these are very attainable goals and will increase your primary income by 20, 50, 100%. As opposed to any side-gig where you'll be lucky getting a return of minimum wage.

Do gigs outside of your main job because you *enjoy* it."
"2329","Hey there son, folks around here know me as ""The Manager."" Let me give you a little bit of advice, line by line.  


&gt; would like to work in a job where I'll get to build AI powered software and hopefully not data analysis work.

This is a poor attitude to have. Hey, it's great to have dreams, it's great to strive for something, heck I encourage it in my employees. But, fact of the matter is, you're just a young buck fresh outta school and you need to start at the bottom! You're not going to be the big cheese without putting in your dues. I'm just saying, try not to be close-minded.  


&gt; The reason I'd like to avoid data analysis jobs is that I absolutely  love coding, and these jobs only involve coding to the extent of  preprocessing the data. 

A job is just a title. ""Coding"" means a lot of different things. Think about the *value you are providing*. Someone who can generate meaningful reports can directly affect the business ROI, and more than anything, money talks in this world.  


&gt; My question is, what kind of skills do I need to acquire besides python  and deep learning models building ? I'd like to dedicate the next 6  months to build these skills. 

Don't just think about technical stuff. You need soft skills too. Learn how to conduct yourself in a professional manner. Learn how to work in an office setting. Learn how to improve your work ethic. Learn how to give presentations and understand everything from the code you write to the QA testing processes to the business side of things.  


&gt; Also what kind of job titles do I need to look for ? I guess it wouldn't  be data scientist/analyst. Does it fall into the category of machine  learning engineer ? 

Wouldn't focus too much on the job titles, focus on the job *responsibilities.* Look at thejob description and technology used, look at the company's mission statement, look at folks you may be working with on LinkedIn. That will provide a lot more information than just a couple of words in a title."
"2330","Uh, a data science/machine learning position right out of college isn't a big deal. He should absolutely aim for that. My former company hired Junior data scientists and ML engineers out of college all the time.

The rest of your advice seems pretty reasonable. But, those positions have entry levels."
"2331","Thank you for your detailed answer !

&gt;But, fact of the matter is, you're just a young buck fresh outta school and you need to start at the bottom

Yes this is true, what would a career path to achieve that ''big dream'' be ? What jobs should I start with to slowly build that expertise ?

&gt;Don't just think about technical stuff. You need soft skills too.

That is so true and 100% agree with you. I've been steadily working on building and perfecting them. I'm aware the biggest challenge for this kind of job is to communicate with people who don't necessarily understand the technical stuff and present the impact of your work in simple terms.

&gt;Wouldn't focus too much on the job titles, focus on the job responsibilities.

Alright I'll keep that in mind.

Thank you again for your detailed answer !"
"2332","You want to do AI and not understand your data? Yikes. AI is all about data analysis, data sanitizing, and so forth."
"2333","Learn math, study block chain, learn cryptography, and then stop talking about blockchain."
"2334","There's nothing inherently groundbreaking about it. It won't solve all of our problems. It isn't even that interesting anymore. Feel free to get into it. It is applied cryptography. Have fun."
"2335","I dont know any silver bullet in technology space. Calling out Blockchain saying it doesnt solve all problems is bullshit. Try to look at the area of problems it solves. Needs more time for customer adaptation. I was asking for a list of skills to have for blockchain"
"2336","I gave you one in my first post. Learn math and cryptography. Then you'll realize that blockchain is just one of many types of applied crypto."
"2337","you need a time machine to travel to 2017"
"2338","I would learn AWS over GCP."
"2339","I mean, all of these are good to know, but I wouldn't learn TS on its own. Do you know a front end framework like React, Vue, or Angular? TS seems a bit out of place in this list, being mostly used for front end.

Regarding GCP: couldn't hurt to learn, but as someone else suggested, I'd also recommend Azure or AWS over GCP, just because they're much more common."
"2340","It could sound weird, I feel more intrigued by GCP than AWS and Azure because I find Google's technology more interesting. Like the design of MapReduce is one example."
"2341","Experience and overall exposure to the jargon. It's basically like an accent. Move somewhere new and after a while, somebody notices you sound different."
"2342","Regarding presentations and Q&amp;A talks, I think all you can do is just lots of practice. Practice alone, then with someone you feel comfortable with, then a small group of you can etc...  as for the stuff you said before that, maybe its just a subconscious mental block affecting you or even a legit medical issue.  I often straight up forget words in similar situations.  Think its just a nerves thing."
"2343","yeah I agree. I think it is a mental block thing. It can be kind of upsetting sometimes when it happens, but it's probably something that requires a lot of exposure first to push through."
"2344","Apart from practicing a lot, reading can help. Some technical authors have reputations as ""great explainers"", and I find that reading their literature tends to help."
"2345","I like this advice :)

Any recommendations?"
"2346","You'll likely need to find some authors who write well about the topics you're interested in. My research area has mostly been relational databases, and I realize it's not for everyone. In that area, I can recommend [C.J. Date](https://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/2136)."
"2347","I listen to technical podcasts almost exclusively to help with my technical communication skills. As another commenter said, it's like an accent, repeated exposure helps you pick up the jargon and patterns of speech."
"2348","I started listening to Programming Throwdown on Spotify during my commutes. Any other tech podcasts you would also recommend?"
"2349","Just talk your self through your code when you review and document (out loud if you need to)"
"2350","Focusing on the specific field isn't the best way to apply Cal Newport's idea of acquiring valuable skills. The reason is that machine learning fields are likely to change a *lot* in the future, and the popular areas and technologies will be different 5 years from now compared to today.

Instead, step back one level and ask what skills are highly valuable and transferable across different areas of machine learning. For example:

1) general research skills

2) management and leadership skills

3) software engineering skills

4) applied mathematics and statistics skills

5) business knowledge

6) particular programming languages (e.g., Python)

7) etc.

If you gain a wide variety of experience in those skills, you'll be able to apply your skills to *any* area of machine learning. Those are the sorts of rare, valuable skills that Cal Newport has in mind."
"2351","Id say nlp is still nascent. Models are improving quickly, but concrete use cases are still limited. Computer vision is useful with a ton of concrete use cases. But its easy enough that its really not that much more valuable than being a regular software engineer."
"2352","NLP has way more potential and room to grow imo. Even the best NLP systems and chatbots are quite bad, to be frank, partially because language itself is extremely complex. For vision we can do a lot of the tasks quite well such as facial recognition, object detection, style transfer, etc. and there is less room for improvement and exploration imo. NLP has a much higher ceiling imo and we have not even tapped into a fraction of its potential yet"
"2353","Sometimes the cost of trying to answer a question is larger than any difference in the options. Just pick one and get started. Even if you were to convince yourself of a good reason to pick one, your next problem will be CV applied to X or CV applied to Y?"
"2354","Both are in demand right now, and will be for the near future, so both are valuable. I don't think you need to worry too much about which is more valuable as long as demand for both skills still exceeds the supply of relevant talent. However, there is both transferable knowledge and domain-specific knowledge, so I would focus on learning the transferable knowledge first as /u/tl_throw suggests, then pivot to learning domain-specific knowledge if you decide you prefer one over the other. Many companies have jobs specific to NLP or Vision, but few have jobs involving both, so it can still make sense to specialize to some degree."
"2355","Ability to learn new frameworks quickly, good hygiene. That's basically all you need."
"2356","And ability to implement things in a scalable, testable and maintainable way"
"2357","the technical skills will depend on the job, a lot of desirable skills ive seen. listed are React, Redux, Angular, jquery, and formatting/css

for non technical skills, sociability is huge, i wouldnt want someone working with me who wont interact with their coworker and be friendly and promote good company culture. other than that, more obvious ones are work ethic, signs of good mental health, being physically healthy"
"2358","A year and a half is sufficient time to get a proper publication out if you're diligent and you have a good team supporting you. If you want to be a researcher, publishing and presenting that work are the things that give you credibility. There's really no other way around it.

Talk to your advisor about this so he or she can help you carve out a project where you can take the lead and have something done before you graduate."
"2359","Thanks for the reply. I suppose you're right, there's not really an alternative way.

This may be appropriate for another entire question, but what should a student do if their advisor isn't exactly helpful? I don't want to talk negatively about my advisor, but he's one of those professors who seem more like a business person than a researcher. He rarely ever advises students and even setting up an appointment with him is extremely difficult. This also happens to be one of the reasons why I decided not to do my PhD in the lab I'm at now and go for some work experience instead."
"2360","That's a crappy situation and it sucks you're in it. Your advisor is supposed to help you establish your own credibility by guiding you throw the research process. If he's not doing that, then going elsewhere is a pretty good idea, whether that means going off to industry or finding a different advisor (as another reply mentioned). In some groups, there's a fairly senior PhD student or postdoc who can give good guidance. That might be another thing to look for if you don't want to switch advisors."
"2361","Look into changing advisors? I did and while tough at the time mid-PhD it was the best decision I ever made in grad school. Also while nice to have publications or posters or something, finishing an MS without that is not the rarest thing, at least in my experience in the US."
"2362","On your resume have your Master degree and the expected graduation date, and then under that, put the info about the ML &amp; DL research that you're doing."
"2363","If you've contributed to code, tools, etc., you should absolutely put that down. When we're hiring, aside from publications that's what I'll look at. Publications aren't required unless you're getting close to finishing your PhD, in which case I would be a little concerned."
"2364","To become respected SDE:

1.	Buy a suit and take lots of good photos for the gram (bitches love the gram)
2.	Write out answers from leetcode on whiteboard and take photos saying leetcode hard done in 15 min. Proud of myself
3.	Buy followers so you have social proof confirming you are respected SDE on the gram

You are now an SDE with the respect of others, as you have desired."
"2365","Not exactly what I was looking for but Ill take it."
"2366","He wasnt the hero we needed, but he was the hero we deserved."
"2367","For me, what I remember depends on the importance of the information to me. The thing about school is I would remember it for the exam and then say I don't need this information anymore. You got to get out that mindset of there being an exam. There is no exam in the workforce. Just projects divided into a bunch of tasks. You need the information forever, so make note of that.  

Also, if your memory is actually bad, write things down in a notebook."
"2368","Thank you thats good perspective!"
"2369","1) Understand the ops (infrastructure, platform engineering, etc) side of things. Not just in an abstract sense, but an actual day-to-day functional sense. Maybe do a rotation with an ops team, if your employer does that sort of thing. It a rare software developer that really becomes great at their job without a real solid understanding of ops.

2) Learn to write trustworthy tests. The whole point is for you to be confident about your code, not to jump through some mandatory hoop. If youre not able to write tests youre confident about, thats a skills gap you should fill. If you view tests as a waste of time, thats a mind-set that should change. 

3) Really learn about the actual business domain youre working in. Engineers who can actually relate technical work to actual business value are basically wizards that have a magic wand they can wave to justify their teams budget. 

4) Use the standard patterns and common programming models. Theres a bunch of them, it takes a while. Theres no shortcut here, you just have to actually write a wide variety of different software on different platforms with different frameworks and libraries to develop the skill."
"2370","Thanks for the input I will try to look for different ways to develop this skill"
"2371","Programming a lot helps. Pick up some devops skills, know your way around infrastructure. Deliver solutions to problems."
"2372","Thanks for the tip!"
"2373","One thing you can try is utilizing what you learnt with actual work. Implement small projects alone or with another developer. Learning Python? Develop a working app with it. It can be something simple, like address book implementation with proper back-end. Learning AWS? Change the backend so it would use AWS instead of a local database."
"2374","Thank you for the input, I learned python and java in my first year and havent touched them since and thats my fault."
"2375","Come up with projects that deliver value. Deliver projects with value. Repeat. Also if you are ever going to complain to a superior about something regarding process have a solution ready to correct it."
"2376","Thank you !"
"2377","Just completely depends on the company. In general be comfortable with designing things and organizing code effectively, in addition to the typical coding stuff."
"2378","Do you mind explaining the typical coding stuff. I am asking that because I feel that something that could be an obvious skill for someone at a competitive tech company might not be that obvious for me. I am looking to interview because I feel like I have not gained much experience and expertise working in fintech as compared to someone at working at FANG."
"2379","Sure, and thanks for calling that out. I think in general just knowing about the major data structures and algorithms, but also knowing how to use them with a given problem and language. For instance, if you are going to interview in C++ then make sure you know the basic containers and stl components for solving problems efficiently. 

In general I would expect someone coming in as an SDE2 (here at least) to dissect a problem into proper sub-components, design a solution to a problem based on these sub-components, leveraging the right pieces of a language to solve it, and explaining the trade-offs or ambiguities that can stem from the problem and the proposed solution.

On the non-tech side I would expect them to know how to effectively communicate with others. How well do they deal with conflict, and what is an approach they would use for a given scenario? If something misses a deadline how do you handle that? It's important to clearly explain your processes and thoughts to others, so I would definitely be looking for that."
"2380","Its true to an extent that the coding test arent applicable to real world problems but most companies use them anyway to find the potential candidate in their problem solving thinking. Thats how the system works. 

I personally despise them too but it is how it is. The thing is most IT interviews on site usually last much longer than other field interviews which makes me feel fatigued from having to study these algorithm and data structure just for the sake of nailing the tests but at the end of the day, it benefits me as well since I know more. Knowledge is power after all. My two cent."
"2381","What if those same concepts get more streamlined towards the company tech stack and job profile needs and be relevant to what's is applicable, all these concepts(ds and algos) are applied everyday to solving a real world problem, scoping it out to what's required rather then a generalist approach makes it irrelevant as the author I post mentioned that he had to go back in time and look at merge sort which is more relevant if you are frsh out of school, as a senior developer your challenges are different and scoping it out is where the money is at"
"2382","Thats why most senior developers who have few years of experience tend to forget those ds and algo stuff and feel the need to revise them again when they looking for a new company. You can tell from majority of the people on this sub that brags about doing LeetCode 8 hours a day just to get into the big name companies based on their post. 

To me, I personally dont think you need to focus so hard on it. Its more of an ability to think logically and solve real world problem at the end of the day rather than memorizing LeetCode solutions which brings no value."
"2383","It's worth it in that they filter out people who don't know the basics very well and who can't model simple problems in code."
"2384","Well you wouldn't get so far in your career if it wasn't for solving those small problems, seems counter intuitive when you have to focus on things totally unrelated to job, CS is vast and when you specialize in a certain field, generic tests like ones from leetcode are a archaic way to really evaluate someone."
"2385","I wouldn't call testing the basics 'archaic'."
"2386","That's not what I intended to say, I meant the way of testing is archaic, may be a new format which includes both fundamentals and job specific requirement like a small project in that line of work is what is needed"
