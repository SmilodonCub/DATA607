## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r message=FALSE}
library( tidyverse )
```

```{r}
disaster_URL <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SmilodonCub/DATA607/master/DisasterDeclarationsSummaries.csv'
disaster_DF <- read_csv( disaster_URL )
head( disaster_DF )
```
```{r}
names( disaster_DF )
```
```{r}
nrow( disaster_DF)
```
```{r}
unique( disaster_DF$incidentType )
```
