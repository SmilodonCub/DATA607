"4","I actually worked for a season next to the DAIP office in Duluth. They were extremely sexist. I was informed that walking down the hall to the shared bathroom was too intimidating because I was male and many of their program attendees had issues with males. Sometimes ~~if~~ I'd go and wash my hands and forget to lock the door. They called and complained to my boss and said that of a woman opened the door and i was in the bathroom, she's be intimidated because I was male."
"5","That closely mirrors a bad experience I had with those groups as well. My cousin worked in a women's shelter, and asked me one weekend to help them out with some moving they were doing. I went by the address she gave me, and looked for someone, and waited in my car for about 15 minutes. Finally, someone approached me cautiously and asked who I was. I gave them my cousin's name and told them I'd been asked to come by and help out. They knew extra people had been asked to help, but thought I looked dangerous, and I was told they thought I was some husband who had found the location of the shelters and was...well, you get the idea.

Yeah, right. I was pretty shocked by that. I mean, I was still a teenager or just a year out of high school, and somehow I look like a dangerous abuser? Even as young as I was though, I knew enough to immediately GTFO. I just said ""oh well, you're probably mostly done, so I'll just go"" and didn't look back. My cousin tried to apologize later, but I just told her: ""Don't worry about it, I learned a lot"", and let her think whatever she wanted about what I'd learned, because it certainly wasn't anything good about those places.

You know, I was just talking with some male friends about how many times in our lives we've been instinctively seen and treated as a threat without any justification, and I realized after some thinking that I can't even count them all. It's probably somewhere in the 50-100 range or thereabouts, but that's still only the ones that I can say for sure. There are certainly more that I was probably not even aware of."
"6","The more important issue is that this is disabling and disempowering.

Shelters have a great *need* for men who are safe.  Trauma survivors require the presence of triggers in order to become desensitized to those triggers and practice their coping strategies.  

Creating a 'male-free' environment is more likely to create greater degrees of generalization as the client is taught to avoid any and all stimuli that might produce discomfort.

"7","Like, you mean that feminists method create more damage, instead of helping? Who would have thought.

I mean, it's been long known that abusers have very often been abused themselves in their youth, so it would seem evident that by hiding half the abusers, they actually help perpetuate the issue, and that most of the abused women of today could blame feminists for refusing to acknowledge the women responsible for the abuse of their abuser, and perpetuating the circle.

But at the same time, if they did acknowledge women abuser, then the number of abused people would drastically drop, so the number of future abuser would also drop, which in turn would diminish a lot the cash-cow the feminist movement has been milking for decades. And they can't have that."

[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228350210\_Gender\_symmetry\_in\_partner\_violence\_The\_evidence\_the\_denial\_and\_the\_implications\_for\_primary\_prevention\_and\_treatment](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228350210_Gender_symmetry_in_partner_violence_The_evidence_the_denial_and_the_implications_for_primary_prevention_and_treatment)

**Method 1. Suppress Evidence**

Researchers with a commitment to the idea that men are almost always the sole perpetrator, or whose commitment to increase services to women victims of PV is so strong that it overrides their commitment to science, as shown previously, often leads to concealing evidence that contradicts this belief. In addition, many researchers not committed to that ideology have withheld results showing gender symmetry to avoid becoming victims of vitriolic denunciations and ostracism (see Method 7 below). A typical pattern is to publish only the data on male perpetrators or female victims, deliberately omitting data on female perpetrators and male victims. This practice started with one of the first general population surveys on family violence. The survey done for the Kentucky Commission On The Status Of Women obtained data on both men and women, but only the data on male perpetration was published (Schulman, 1979). Among the many other examples of respected researchers publishing data on assaults by men and the data on assaults by women are Kennedy and Dutton (1989), Lackey and Williams (1995), Johnson and Leone (2005), and Kaufman Kantor and Straus (1987). 

**Method 2. Avoid Obtaining Or Analyzing Data On Female Perpetration**

Due to prevailing ideology that women are almost never perpetrators of PV and men are almost never victims, researchers designing surveys have typically asked female participants only about attacks by their male partners, and male respondents only about perpetration. To achieve this, the Canadian national Violence Against Women survey (Johnson &amp; Sacco, 1995), modified the Conflict Tactics Scales by omitting the questions on perpetration by the female participants in the study. The American National Violence Against Women Survey (Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000) sponsored by the Department of Justice originally planned the same strategy. Fortunately, the US Centers For Disease Control added a sample of men to the project. But when Johnson and Leone (Johnson &amp; Leone, 2005) investigated the prevalence of intimate terrorists among the participants in that study, they guaranteed there would be no female intimate terrorists by using only the data on male perpetration. Many other studies of PV have also omitted questions about female perpetration and male victimization. Many, agencies do not permit collection of data on PV unless questions on female perpetration are omitted. This may have been the reason that a comprehensive four site study of batterer treatment programs asked the women only about violence by the partner (Gondolf, 2002). This was a tremendous lost opportunity because it may be the only comprehensive study of male offenders which had access to their female partners.

**Method 3. Cite Only Studies That Show Male Perpetration**

Another method used to conceal evidence of gender symmetry is to selectively cite studies of male perpetration and avoid citing studies of female perpetration. US government, World Health Organization, and United Nations documents show that this method of concealment and distortion is institutionalized in official publications. For example, US Dept of Justice publications almost always cite only the National Crime Victimization study, which shows male predominance (Durose et al., 2005). They fail to mention the Department Of Justice published critiques which led to a revision of the survey. but which that only partly corrected that bias (Straus, 1999). Not only do Department of Justice publications on PV rely on data that they previously acknowledged is inaccurate for measuring PV, but they also ignore a major and more accurate study that they themselves sponsored  the National Violence Against Women .Survey. This study found that women perpetrate about 40% of PV incidents, which is close to gender symmetry in perpetration

The widely acclaimed and influential World Health Organization report on domestic violence (Krug et al., 2002) reports that Where violence by women occurs it is more likely to be in the form of self-defense (32, 37, 38). This is selective citation because almost all studies that have compared men and women find about equal rates of self-defense. Perhaps even worse, none of the three studies cited provide evidence supporting the quoted sentence. For example, Study #32 (Saunders &amp; Hanusa, 1986) shows that about two thirds of female perpetrated PV was not in self-defense. Study #37 (DeKeseredy, Saunders, Schwartz, &amp; Shahid, 1997) found that only 7% of women said their violence was in self-defense. Study #38 (Johnson &amp; Ferraro, 2000) is a review paper that has no original data. It cites #32 and #37, neither of which supports the claim.

A closely related method is to present the results on female perpetration/male victimization and say nothing about those results. The 2006 US Department of Justice report on PV gives a chart showing trends for both men and women from 1993 to 2004 (Catalano, 2006b). The only thing said about trends in male victimization, i.e. female perpetration, is that The rate of nonfatal intimate partner victimization for males increased between 2003 and 2004, returning to levels last seen in 1996 (and)1...for white males... (victimization)...increased between 2003 and 2004, from 0.5 to 1.1... It is almost certain that that there would be a commentary and an extensive analysis if Nonfatal PV victimization of white females had increased between 2003 and 2004, from .5 to 1.1 victimizations per 1,000 i.e., if the female victimization rate had doubled. But the doubling in the male victimization rate was ignored."
"12","**Method 4. Conclude That Results Refute Symmetry When They Do Not**

The studies cited above, in addition to be illustrating selective citation, are also examples of the ability of ideological commitment to lead researchers to misinterpret the results of their own research. A study by Kernsmith (2005), for example states that Males and females were found to differ in their motivations for using violence in relationships. (p. 173), and that ""female violence may be more related to maintaining personal liberty in a relationship than gaining power"" (p. 180). Although Kernsmiths Table 2 shows that women had higher scores on the striking back factor, only one question in this factor is about self-defense and this item is endorsed infrequently. Other more frequently endorsed items are about being angry (e.g., ""to show anger"") and getting back at a partner (e.g. ""to get back at your partner for hurting you emotionally""). In contrast to the idea that women use violence to maintain liberty, these finding suggest that women are more likely than men to use violence in retaliatory anger. In addition, Kernsmiths conclusion ignores the fact that the scores for men and women were approximately equal in respect to two of the three factors (exerting power and disciplining partner).Thus, Kernsmiths study generally found the opposite of what was stated as the finding.

**Method 5. Create Evidence By Citation**

The Kernsmiths study, the World Health Organization report, and the pattern of selective citation show how ideology can be converted into evidence by citation or what Gelles (1980) calls the woozle effect. A woozle effect occurs when the frequent citation of assertion in previous publications that lack evidence mislead us into thinking there is evidence. For example, subsequent to the World Health Organization study and the Kernsmith study, papers discussing gender differences in motivation will cite them to show that female violence is predominantly in self-defense, which is the opposite of what the research actually shows. But because these are citations of an article in a scientific journal and a respected international organization, readers of the subsequent article will accept it as a fact. Thus, fiction is converted into scientific evidence that will be cited over and over and further strengthen the woozle effect.

Another well documented example is the claim that the Conflict Tactics Scales (Straus, Hamby, Boney-McCoy, &amp; Sugarman, 1996) does not provide an adequate measure of PV because it measures only conflict related violence. Although the theoretical basis of the CTS is conflict theory, the introductory explanation to participants specifically asks participants to report expressive and malicious violence. It asks respondents about the times when they and their partner ...disagree, get annoyed with the other person, want different things from each other, or just have spats or fights because they are in a bad mood, are tired or for some other reason. Despite repeating this criticism for 25 years in perhaps a hundred publications, we have not located any empirical study which has provided evidence showing that only conflict-related violence is reported. In fact, where there is both CTS data and qualitative data, as in Giles-Sims (1983), it shows that the CTS elicits malicious violence as well as conflict-related violence. Nevertheless, because there are at least a hundred articles with this statement in peer reviewed journals, it is treated as an established scientific fact.

**Method 6. Obstruct Funding of Research That Might Contradict the Idea that Male Dominance Is The Cause of PV**

An example of denying funding to research that might contradict the idea that PV is a male-only crime is the call for proposals to investigate PV issued in December 2005 by the National Institute of Justice. The announcement stated that proposals to investigate male victimization would not be eligible. Another example is the objection by a reviewer to a proposal one of us submitted because of ...naming violence in a relationships as a human problem of aggression not a gender-based problem. When priority scores by the reviewers are averaged, it takes only one extremely low score to place the proposal below the fundable level. Others have encountered similar blocks; for example Holtzworth-Munroe (2005). Eugen Lupri, a pioneer Canadian family violence researcher, has also documented examples of the resistance to funding and publishing research on female perpetrated violence (Lupri, 2004).

**Method 7. Harass, Threaten, And Penalize Researchers Who Produce Evidence That Contradicts Feminist Beliefs**

Suzanne Steinmetz made the mistake of publishing a book and articles (Steinmetz, 1977; Steinmetz, 1977-1978) which clearly showed about equal rates of perpetration by males and females. Anger over this resulted in a bomb threat at her daughters wedding and she was the object of a letter writing campaign to deny her promotion and tenure at the University of Delaware. Twenty years later the same processes resulted in a lecturer at the University of Manitoba whose dissertation found gender symmetry in PV being denied promotion and tenure.

A PhD student working with Straus was warned at a conference that she will never get a job if she does her PhD research with him. At the University of Massachusetts, Straus was prevented from speaking by shouts and stomping. At two hearings held by the Canadian Commission On Violence Against Women the chairperson stated that nothing Murray Straus publishes can be believed because he is a wife-beater and sexually exploits students (Toronto Magazine article, ??). When Straus was elected President of the Society For the Study Of Social Problems, a group of members occupied the first few rows of the auditorium and, at the start of the presidential address, stood up and walked out.

As a result of these types of harassment, there is widespread self-censorship by authors who fear that publishing politically incorrect data will undermine their reputation, or in the case of graduate students, their ability to obtain a job."

We always have reasons, stupid as they can seem when out of the fog, for staying until we finally leave those relationships... for me it was my son, but he was also my strength and the reason I left as soon as the violence got its worst and the third time that night I walked away she called and lied to police.

My dad saved my ass.  He came and bailed me out after the 2-4 days I ended up having to mandatory stay (because of county verse state laws and my first near 24 hours in city, had to do more in county after transfer).  I was pretty fucking close to whatever I can imagine feeling shell shocked must be.  He let me pay him back after getting my finances straight (and helped me think through how to provide for her / my kid while protecting myself and initiating a divorce).  I stayed there for 6 months until I could get her to accept appropriate mediation (would have taken over a year to get any kind of 'emergency custody' or divorce / custody hearing).  I still was too lenient, let her 'waste' over 8 grand before that 6 month period, but I was also playing a longer game to go for full custody in court if she didn't mediate in a way okay for my son and I prior.

"21","I'm amazed at how many people believe domestic violence and sexual abuse are about control. It boggles my mind.

Sure, there are psychopaths where that is happening. But the bulk of it is just people behaving badly.

People feel hurt and anger and they act out and hurt.

Rape especially is perpetrated on younger and prettier men and women. Not because they are powerless, but because they are desired.

Sex abuse with children seems very much to be about a twisted sexual fulfillment as well. From the limited reading I've done it is very much about opportunity and fantasy fulfillment. 
.
Is that a power fantasy? Probably not. I suspect it is more about neotony. All those sexual characteristics of youth that are desired in young adults as targets might also be there in children to some degree.

That last bit about kids is much more speculative than my earlier this about adults."
"22","Ya, the rape part is so out of focus it blows the mind.  In a lot of western countries there is no rape law for men by a woman,  it hidden in lesser charge of forced to penetrate.  It means that if a man comes forward the lesser charge will probably get her a fine or community service and generally are suspended sentences if any.  So no criminal record, no forced to register as a sex offender, and so on.  Well it is Rape and if you include it as rape the male and female rates  of rape get fairly close to equal, in some areas its more.  If you add prison men get raped way more than women.  So do all those women rape men fore power?  I doubt it.    But for some reason its all about the power according to feminist theory but only if men do it.  The Duluth model, total crap.  Hell if I apply the feminist standards of rape Ive been raped. 3 times by women.  Sexually abuse.  I worked in a dance bar first as a bouncer then as a waiter (way better money in tips). I was 19, (Canada). A ranked elite rugby player, and good looking.  Well our uniform was a black bow tie black shorts or pants and white dress shirt.  Thing cheep chip and dales.  Well I was physically sexually assaulted at least 3 times a night. Groped grabbed and fondled.  Hell I cant count the number of times I had to dig my tip out of my underwear.  But for some reason its funny or sexy when men get sexually harassed or assaulted, if a man did a fraction of what I received regularly hed be out on his ass in 10 seconds.  Check out the multiple videos done by students in psychology demonstrating the hypocrisy.    Men get abused and assaulted by a women in the park draws people who watch, laugh, calls out from women as encouragement.  Some even take selfies or video of it.  I think of all the ones Ive seen only one women tried to intervene.  When asked by the student group what the thought, most common answer was he probably deserved it.

"26","&gt; Services do exist for men, they are much more scarce yes, but I believe the way to go about change is to build up support for men, not tear down support for women.

Who is planning to tear down support for women, though?  What made you assume critiquing this regressive model would even infer it as attacking an entire gender?

&gt;I see this model being frequently attacked on this sub

And there's been concrete evidence that it deserves the ire we lob at it.  The obvious one being it doesn't exactly help a male victim of domestic violence to be assumed the dangerous one and carted off to jail.

&gt;but nobody is ever talking about what to do different...

How about treating every domestic violence situation case by case instead of going in with a misandric theory that paints the male gender as always at fault?  That would be a start."
"27","The biggest issues I have with it can be framed within the words used by the framework.

Under the Duluth model, one party is ""the one to define what actions are abusive"".  Just as the model states that ""being the one to define male and female roles"" is a category of power and control, so is having one person define abuse.  

Combine that with ""Making her afraid by..."" and the presence of 'looks' and 'gestures'.

That allows for a situation where getting angry is defined as abuse.  I know for a fact that when I'm upset, my nostrils flare and I start to raise my voice.  That's not abusive behavior.  That's an autonomic response to being frustrated or angry.  

The Duluth Model creates a weird power dynamic where basically anyone can be defined as abusive. 

That makes it unhelpful.

I have worked with some people who used the model, and it almost always escalated issues rather than deescalating.

For a better way to work through things, I recommend basically any communication enhancing tool.  Even simple things like getting people to use ""I feel"" statements and expressing their wants in clear terms works much better.

One of my favorites is just to ask both parties to write down their expectations and their responsibilities.

Even when working with abusive relationships, using those techniques exposed abuse far more readily than trying to analyze the behaviors themselves.  Having one partner talk on and on about their expectations and go silent when asked about their responsibilities isn't exactly subtle, and exposes the underlying issue, that being that one partner is being a selfish fuckwit and wants a lot while giving very little.

Basically, it's too simple for therapy, too broad for the courtroom, and really doesn't offer much beyond raising awareness."
"28","&gt; Services do exist for men

&gt; male behavior change program 

Right, and how many female behavior change programs do the offer? How many male victim services?

&gt; build up support for men, not tear down support for women

It's not about tearing down support for anyone. Only that the criteria for support should not be based on gender.

Duluth model also guides arrest policies FYI. One of the reasons that abused men get arrested is because they show police all these biased stats about how 98% of DV victims are female, and how the primary aggressor is the one that is more 'physically intimidating' or 'capable of causing injury'. It also describes female violence as inherently 'defensive'."
"29","Nobody wants to tear down support for women.  But men are not even allowed to ask for support, much less have it.  Read up on the tremendous amounts of opposition (up to and including salacious, libelous attacks on the advocates) faced by those wanting to build men's shelters and nothing more."
"30","I will chime in with my two cents since I work with the same stack as you - if you aren't a great data architect, that'd be a good skill to pick up. Building pipelines is great, but understanding the pros and cons of streaming analytics vs. building a daily process. I also think learning a bit of OOP to help, which it sounds like you're doing (Java UDFs, UDAFs, Python) to allow you to manipulate those massive data sets effectively - or even using Spark for streaming since you're using Kafka quite a bit.

Scala and Spark aren't going anywhere anytime soon. Same with Apache Flink, though that's still in the nurture phase.

You won't see any companies aside from cutting edge using Kafka or Spark streaming, etc., so it's best to keep the old skill architecture and business acumen fresh as well.

Contributing to open source is a phenomenal idea. You'll learn a lot AND you'll be able to stay on top of new tech. That keeps you desireable in the marketplace.

2. You can do powerful find/replace commands. I have taken rows of Excel strings that I want to convert into a comma list for use in R that take seconds to format in Sublime. Find and replace ""\n"" "", "" to turn every new line entry into a comma separated list that can be copied and pasted into R/Python.

3. Ctrl+Shift+K otherwise known as multiple selections. You can edit in more than one place at once. It works as a quick substitute for find and replace, or to apply the same sequence of changes to multiple lines simultaneously. Basically, let's say you want to add the same text to 40 lines of code but in different places. You can multiple select all the places you want something then type it out and it appears in every selection space.

"51","Learn To Code is the most appropriate meme ever created, since it's origin was in the cold and generally inconsiderate response journalists and writers kept giving manufacturing workers whenever their jobs went overseas. Besides being unethical, it's bad journalism since half of journalism requires at least a tactful approach to sources and topics so that they'll be honest when giving information and lead to better information/sources being provided.

This isn't a tech problem, it's an ethics problem. The general decline of journalist unions (which horrifyingly mirrors the decline of manufacturing unions) and tentpole journalism (print newspapers, broadcast radio, broadcast TV) has caused the entire industry to be overrun by people who treat daily periodicals like their blog or a book and don't give it the serious, objective analysis befitting of a journal. This, inevitably, leads to trust in the media deteriorating as it stops fulfilling it's original function of information gathering and storage (which is a thing the web age never concerns itself with, unless you're a software pirate)."

"55","Publicly funded media, arts programs, and stipends for books wouldn't have prevented this since the problem also exists in countries that have all of that where people simply choose commercial services instead, in no small part because commercial media tells people exactly what they want to hear.

Not that I necessary disagree with your point, but I consider it misguided. The lack of any sort of web marketing regulation certainly contributes to the deluge of clickbait, garbage reporting, and tweeting masquerading as journalism but the problem existed before the web got big. It's at least 40 years in the making, and a direct result of individual people themselves deciding they don't want good journalism. Everyone getting pocket communicators was just the breaking point when a majority of society decided they wanted to define their reality, rather than accept it served to them.

On an even more basic level: how do we get children into reading? This was a problem that people began to notice in the 1970s, and could never find a solution to it (Barbera Bush really did try hard though). The next two decades were largely defined by MTV as cable spread, and people chose to give their attention to TV instead of public libraries built over the preceding 50 years. This proved true even within the Soviet Union (a non-capitalist state), where pirated VHS tapes were sought after goods.

Choice and spectacle are addicting, it's easier for someone to just follow a circus (any circus) then sit in a quiet room staring at text. Even if the US adopted full socialism, I don't see how this could be changed."
"56","The problem is journalists. ""Journalism"" nowadays is scarcely more than blue-checkmarks finding the latest thing to be outraged about. ""Journalists"" employed at major neoliberal media corporations (like Vox or the NYT) are basically professional liars and propagandists."

"58","Neglecting perhaps that it is easier to teach a competent data person how to be a journalist than it is to teach a  journalist how to do data analysis? 

Any data person in the academic community, for example, is used to writing papers and sourcing their work.  Some fraction of these have that investigative instinct and whatever else it takes. 

But then are the NYTimes desperately trying to avoid admitting that some unreasonable amount of what happens is shameless access journalism and really nothing to do with ruthless, tenacious and  neutral analysis of the all data available from whatever sources on the subject at hand?"

I asked how we didn't know it wasn't the other way around, that consumers who were less likely to churn also were willing to pay more, and that as you raised price you scared away more churn-likely consumers.. a few blanks stares later and it devolved into me explaining to the fellow the whole causation vs correlation fallacy in statistics."

"71","I've decided the only people who put actual value on coursera (or website of choice) certs are people who have never done them. You can basically turn your brain off, half-ass it, then get the cert.

I'm of the opinion it's better to ask to see a few projects they've done. Even if they're just personal side projects, it's still better than some online certificate from courses of varying rigor and use."
"72","It's true that many days scientists aren't particularly knowledgeable about statistics. However, I've started to see more and more job postings for statistically literate people, especially people with knowledge of causal inference (what I believe to be the next hot thing in data science/analytics)."

"77","Judea Pearl would agree with your opinion. He wrote a whole book on that issue."
"78","Yes, Pearl and his do-calculus is one of the theoretical frameworks related to causal inference. The NeymanRubinHolland model with potential outcomes is another. Moreover, at my old university they were studying some sort of hybrid framework that would combine graphs and potential outcomes via so-called ""node splitting""."

However, it seems like others are trying to combine causal graphs with potential outcomessee for instance: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331670633_A_Potential_Outcomes_Calculus_for_Identifying_Conditional_Path-Specific_Effects.

More specifically, node splitting is at least discussed here, but I can't say if their approach is similar: https://youtu.be/NpNTfvbE1gY."
"81","Thomas Richardson and Jamie Robins, Single World Intervention Graphs. Theres probably some YouTube videos on it."
"82","Have worked with a guy who got in the top 5% in multiple Kaggle competitions. He was self-taught, haven't heard about t-test, and had very vague ideas about causation. Still helped us to develop a complex data pipeline, designed a couple of models still used in production, and finally got poached by a competitor.

In my experience, having a good statistical foundation helps, but it is not mandatory, especially if your task is to provide predictions, not inferences."
"83","Honestly I think this entire discussion is about prediction vs inference. As you said, statistical background isnt a total necessity when tasks only consist of prediction. Who cares about q-q plots when all thats being built is black box models?"
"84","I guess the issue arises when management/outsiders start to conflate prediction with inference. I recently helped out with a clinical research project where the the lab interpreted lasso selection as an oracle for finding the true ""important"" predictors. It was difficult to explain to them the lack of any statistical guarantees of the variable selection, especially given that we had *p &gt; n*.

I've heard many data scientists say that communicating the results is a huge part of the job, and I think it's at least important to be able to address the inferential limitations of predictive black box models."
"85","Check out some papers by Chernozhukov and Belloni on Lasso. They show that in a p&gt;n setting you can get causal inference by doing something called double-selection in Lasso."
"86","And isn't anything above linear/logistic regression essential a black box? 
It's my opinion that if you need a complex model be it tree based or deep learning, then your data simply is very complex and you can't make any simple conclusions from it that you can directly implement in real-world."
"87","And this is why in bioinformatics (and biology in general), we always have to go validate our results in the lab. The discussion is always, ""Yeah, cool, so you found 10 major driver genes... Did any of them actually work though?""

It's a pretty interesting debate we have, because sometimes good statistics just doesn't work in the lab, whereas some, not *bad*, but, less than ideal, statistics finds ""real"" hits."
"88","Forgive my ignorance but isn't inference important when doing predictions? I'd love to hear where this breaks down as I'm not knowledgable enough about statistics."
"89","To my understanding... The difference is the *focus*.

Inference is more concerned with the ""why"" and digging into the relationships between things.

Like finding the extent to which age affects the probability of someone not defaulting on a loan.

Inference is useful for decision support. Like... ""Variable A is the main reason why we lose customers. So let's target that to reduce churn"".

Whereas prediction is a ""proof is in the pudding"" focus. Even though prediction is built upon inferential statistics.

So the focus would be in accurately predicting who will default on loans rather than the ""why"" behind each particular variable.

However... with the credibility and explainability crisis I expect that a greater focus will be on the why questions in the near future. More and more regulation will be in place forcing data scientists to explain how and why their algorithm made its decision. 

So I think in the future, the simple and models with explainable outcomes will tend to triumph for most business use cases. Those algorithms will stand up to audits and would facilitate things like a customers right to know why they were denied a loan.

This may not be a 100% accurate explanation, but according to Cunninghams Law... if its not then we will know soon."
"90","As you said, often times the two are intertwined, interpretibility is huge area of research for a reason. You need to explain why you made a prediction, and inherent to that is some implicit causality.

I don't think it means that nn and tree models are going away, but understanding how to interpret models correctly is part of the prediction skill set imo."
"91","I suppose this is exactly why DS folks shouldn't de-emphasize inferential statistics."

"97","It can matter if you want to know the best levers you need to pull to improve the prediction (in context of the model).

E.g. -- deciding compensation for hiring one more sales persons with background knowledge X results in Y sales."
"98","The thing is, data science is a broad field. Those who have all the skills are extremely rare. The best thing is to get a team that has all the skills and have them work together."
"99","I agree. We also have someone like that and he developed end to end solutions and delivered it to the customers beautifully. A large tech company in SFO area poached him. This person had a very basic stats understanding."
"100","I think it's about the right domain.

Prediction is *wonderful* if fundamental things about the world don't change. Marketing response prediction works great until bad press hits (e.g. Wells Fargo). It's enormously difficult to pivot from reduced form models (typical builds for prediction) to structural models needed to disentangle deep parameters -- and even those aren't fool proof!"
"101","This discussion is as old as data science and it's very close to discussions in CS about 'real programmers'. I will tell you something as someone, who worked in data science for several years: statistical theory in data science is pretty overrated. It's not that you don't need it, but what you describe is not a lack of understanding math, it's a lack of common sense and domain understanding. 

Data Science at the university is research oriented and in the industry it's pretty rare, that you are able to dive deep into methodologies. Usually understanding your domain is much more important. Furthermore, visualization and storytelling are the most important skills as a data scientist in advanced analytics. The truth is, that data science is not different to other roles. In the end it does not matter if much if your findings are 100% correct as long, they look impressive to your stakeholders and just work. 

When we look at predictive analytics, it gets even more interesting. People build models, which predict the cause of a feature or include data leakage and promote the huge accuracy model as breakthrough, without being skeptical. You dont need a deep understanding of stats, to understand that it does not give you much benefit to use these predictions. In the end the model will just not work.

The good thing is, all these wrong assuptions and results are usually discovered later on (A/B tests, KPIs, whatever) and you learn from it. I doubt that statistical theory helps you to avoid all these mistakes in a **time-efficient** way."
"102","&gt;but what you describe is not a lack of understanding math, it's a lack of common sense and domain understanding.

But when you put it this way, I guess I'm being foolish to wait until I'm completely ready to be data scientist.

"116","You're missing something fundamental here. If people were just looking for a simple answer to a question then very likely they would Google the question and get the answer. in the context of Reddit that means they would search the Reddit threads and get the answer

However, in this and many other subreddits people are looking to have a discussion. They're looking to explore the issue, discuss the complexities in general and perhaps how it may relate to their specific situation.

You state that the discussion might not have any merit unless something new is brought to the table. how would you know if something new is brought to the table unless you have the discussion?

It's my experience that most often you do not find valuable, previously unknown ideas just coming out of the woodwork completely formed and ready to go. In my professional life these sorts of rare and valuable original solutions or perspectives come from discussion amongst peers and colleagues. How could we ever do that if we limited our topics to things that were not already discussed previously.

Ultimately, Reddit isn't stack exchange. It's a forum for discussion, a place that people talk about things. I talked about a lot of things before that doesn't necessarily mean that I don't enjoy or benefit from having a discussion with someone new."
"117","Considering how a significant portion of our community is people trying to break into the field, I think it's healthy to have a periodic reminder that statistical expertise needs to be a part of the professional expectations for the role. Further, I think the data science community is overdue to come up with new language to differentiate what we used to call a data scientist, and the ""data analyst *plus*"" qualification that has been lowering the bar."
"118","Yeah, unfortunately when people want to get perspectives on something on Reddit, their impulse is to post first rather than search first. 

(Or people *do* search first, read relevant comment threads, still want to make their own thread on the topic, but opt against referencing all the existing perspectives they've just read? Seems unlikely, but it is a possibility)"
"119","I can't remember where I read it, but it was basically the same thing you said.  It applied to 'big data.'  Basically, the gripe was that there was a lot of data, but the necessary assumptions about the data and analysis often aren't being examined leading to heavily biased results and spurious correlations. 

My problem with 'data science' in general is that there is no real definition of what constitutes a data scientist as opposed to a statistician.   This can be seen in the various curriculums being offered for data science and the job postings out there."
"120","I know what youre talking about, but dont forget that data science is extremely broad and somewhat ill defined. 

You appear to be talking more about inference than straight-up prediction, which can be two different animals. 

The thing I see missing from the data scientists I work with is the *science* part. Theyre great coders and they understand the math and the parts to get models to work, but they dont seem to grasp the scientific process, which is as important as the modeling."
"121","What are they missing in terms of scientific process though?"
"122","Websters Dictionary defines science as...lol just kidding. 

Science is the systematic study of a topic. To systematically study something you need to structure your ideas into hypotheses, formally test them, and document everything. Science is reproducible research. 

The teams Ive worked with dont do this. It is a foreign idea for them to document things that dont work or produce desired results (i.e., *negative results*). However, knowing what doesnt work is often as important as knowing what does work. 

It is an ongoing battle to get them to simply document everything they do, which makes replicating their results impossible.

In predictive analytics you don't really care about what the coefficient mean, as long as it ""works."" Much more mathematical.

While causal inference relies more heavily on domain knowledge IMO and you ONLY care about the coeffiecients.

One is about Y_hat and the other is about beta_hat.

Also, at least for business data, adding in a ""few controls"" isn't any more robust. You need to control for **everything** to have causal inference, usually by some type of experimental design."
"125","&gt; While causal inference relies more heavily on domain knowledge IMO and you ONLY care about the coeffiecients.

Eh... sort of? Depends on the domain. Causal inference is closer to diff-in-diff, and isn't the only use for descriptive modeling.

E.g. credit risk scoring *requires* descriptive reasons for rejecting a credit score."
"126","I would argue diff and diff is causal inference, when experimenting is impossible.

I guess maybe moreso, arguing that you only care about some coefficients. In my econometrics class, our diff-in-diff was a regression coefficient."
"127","Yep! The techniques behind D-D aren't insane. An experiment is basically a D-D by its nature -- due to random assignment, the initial diff is approximately 0. D-D is definitely a *part* of causal inference, not the sum-total. Apologies for lacking clarity."
"128","One of the small number of ""most important# things I have learned in my 20s is that there are,very very very few people that actually know what they are doing. This goes for all ""experts"" across all fields.  It just seems to be this snowball effect of human nature where people to want to look up to someone as an expert, while at the same time people getting literally high from the praise.  What results is a bunch of people who think politicians, scientists, doctors, etc.. Are these anti-human superhero geniuses who are immune to criticism outside of their field.  And this happens on the micro level to.  Pretty much all of the typical heroes the MSM and school systems like to prop up were horribly flawed in reality.  

So ya. This obviously ia happening in ""data science"".  Theres too mich breadth and not enough depth.  I'm an expert in 1.5 things. Goalkeeping for sure and Food Service Operations in a general customer service operational standards sense. It took me being a literal genius and about a decade of experience in both to accomplish that.  Once you really know something well for the first time, you realize how hard it is to do and how few people have ever achieved this.  Probably 1 or 2 out of 100 ""data scientists"" really know what they are doing.  Probably a few more than that are experts in some subset of the field.

Specifically though, my Masters in Data Analytics from WGU focused quite a bit on statistics.  They didnt require you to memorize it, and I certainly didn't, but it exposed it the statistixs to me three different times in three different ways.  I know enough to know how much I dont know in the field, and what I would need to figure out to accomplish some sort of meaningful model. 

That all being said, the whole field is dangerous.  So many managers and users of this data don't want it done correctly.  They dont want to pay for the resources to produce something that, if done correctly, likely will tell them they might be on to something but probably need to spend more money to get a definitive answer if its possible at all.  They just want to be able to pretend to be using the new trend for vanity reasons, or they just want to pay someone to tell them how good of a job they are doing and how their current projects are supposed to result in better financial performance.. Regardless of the actual truth behind it.. Which is that in reality its almost impossible to do this with accuracy.  I say that meaning with how projects tend to be aligned.  Obviously in theory, and sometimws in practice, you can define the question narrow enough with solid enough underlying data to draw meaningful conclusions. Its just extremely rare."

"131","Originally ""data science"" in the industry became popular as a discipline for more predictive applications in which causal inference doesn't play a big role, and was previously dominated by classical statisticians using SAS. CS/Engineering folks got an edge by just using python, xgboost and modern development practices, especially in tech companies.

&amp;#x200B;

Following this success and all the buzz, corporations started to hire the same type of people to do all data stuff that was previously dominated by analysts using Excel (these guys are falling for these statistical fallacies for ages, the only difference is that their methods are shallow enough to management with some business feeling to call BS on them) - including applications where causal inference is central. Not only that, many corporations just started to rename whatever they called their Excel analysts with ""data scientists"" to attract employees.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, technological buzzwords won't solve causal inference - in fact they could lead to more BS vendors going undetected and I'm afraid that the movement in overall with harm more than benefit society in the short term."
"132","I think that there are many types of Data Scientists and many types of jobs/companies. In some places deep statistical analysis is necessary, in others it isn't required.

&amp;#x200B;

In essence this is a question: is data science/ machine learning a glorified statistics or not?

Or: is causal relationships or quality of predictions ? (as many people in this thread already said)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm biased and think that the quality of predictions is much more important for business.

* It is true that you could design a great experiment and make a study of variables, you could look for multicollinearity, run statistical tests and do other things. It would work and be really important in some cases. But if we talk about practice, it is much easier to train gradient boosting model, which doesn't require such assumptions as linear models.
* Sometimes people say that gradient boosting models are black boxes and can't be understood. I disagree - there a lot of tools and technics to do this like LIME, ELI5, SHAP, partial dependency plots and other things. Of course they don't reveal causal relationship between variables and target... but they show how changes in the variable will influence the target which is good enough.
* Also clever technics can replace old tools at least in terms of efficiency. For example it is important to check that the distribution of variables in training data is similar to their distribution in the new data. We could run statistical tests to compare distributions... or we could use adversarial validation.
* And all of this was about ""research"" stages of the projects. When we talk about putting models in production, it is much more important to write good code and pipeline, make a reproducible machine learning project. In companies with developed infrastructure the models would make predictions automatically, their performance would be monitored, if there are signs of model deterioration, then the models would be automatically retrained;
* Also I suppose this discussion is more relevant to classification and regression models. What about recommendation systems? Graph networks? Deep learning on texts and images?

Nevertheless I agree that it is necessary to have at least some knowledge of statistics and common sense. I saw cases when people made serious mistakes due to the lack of critical thinking. But this is more about critical thinking than statistics."
"133","I work with Data Science since 2015, this profile is very common unfortunately. When I started to work on Data Science it was on the field of Natural Language Processing and I have a really brief knowledge of statistics.

Now, after some years, I have more background on probability&amp;statistics theory, as I completed the course of Probability&amp;statistics and Stochastics Processes on the college (Computer Engineering course).

But even more common than that it's data scientist that cannot build software, but only jupyter notebooks. In my view is not a worse problem than not know anything of the theory behind, but well... programming in data science is a serious skill too.

As you said, there is more interesting in making the models seems pretty than correct in the analysis view, but I would said that remains the same at software engineering architecture.

For all that reason, I think building a culture behind Data Science is very important. This year I created a Project Template to help on that."
"134","As an aspiring data scientist, this is something I know I am lacking in.

What would you recommend someone like me, who is trying to improve their understanding of statistics, do? Are there any good online sources, or should I just grab a few books and drill down?"
"135","I'm gonna be frank with you: statistics is a difficult subject, and it takes some time and effort to learn it, so while there are some online sources to learn particular concepts, I really think that you would benefit from a book that offers a more structured approach to the topic.

Regarding a good book for learning some statistics, it depends to an extent on what field you want to work, but for the basics I think that it shouldn't make that much of a difference. It depends on what math background you have, but if it is low ( or non existent), I found the book ""Statistics for Business and Economics"" by Newbold et al quite easy and aprocheable when I took my first course in statistics, and it should include most basic topics of probability theory and some regression.

 In adittion, if you are interested in regression analysis you can't go wrong with introductory econometrics by Wooldridge, one of the most useful books I have ever used, quite comprehensive and easy"
"136","I'm a BS Economics student and Wooldridge is indeed a great book to learn linear regression and panel data (longitudinal for statisticians). For time series I think the best book would be Gujarati. For some reason I got some difficult with Wooldridge approach.

By the way, I took my econometrics classes almost a year ago, I remember the theory quite well, but the proves like how to get the estimation of the betas in linear regression using matrices approach is one example I don't remember. Do you think this is important to know or I'm good remember just theory?"
"137","Depends what you plan to do. If you wanna go into academia  is something quite important to know. If you are going to the private sector to a work that is mostly applied stats or econometrics tohugh, I don't think knowing proofs by heart is that valuable. Knowing the intuition of the concepts and what that proof is supossed to show should be more than enough (at least if you are not on a really technical position, but you need a PHD for those anyway)"
"138","Which Gujarati book are you referring to? Basic Econometrics?"
"139","Yes. That one."
"140","Personally , I would recommend  Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data
By Wooldridge. 

This a little more advanced text but it help to really understand the model . I find his introduction book not enough too understands the key concept and this book talk about other regression type than just OLS ."
"141","A second opinion, but if you're focused on predictive analytics and more ""CS"" applications of data science (NLP type stuff or deep learning), I don't think learning causal inferences is useful for you, beyond knowing what your models DON'T do."
"142","I've worked for 40 years now (not in data science), having graduated in Comp. Sci. in 1978, and agree with many of the comments here - especially that very few people really know what they're doing. Real experts understand that and tend to be the most modest people you will meet -- unlike bullshitters. As someone said, the more you know, the more you realise what you don't know.

A good data scientist really needs it all - excellent software development skills, good stats knowledge, good data skills, good inter-personal skills and domain expertise -- which is almost impossible.

I'd like to add something about programming. People who are not trained in software development generally write bad code. There are exceptions (both ways - I've seen Comp. Sci. graduates who can't program) but, generally, you can tell the educated programmer from the rest. Really good programming skills are often under-valued in debates about what makes a good data scientist."
"143","As a decent programmer, the recruiters have funneled me into a career as a data engineer, instead of data scientist.

These companies really believe a data scientist's programming skills don't need to be any greater than the ability to run scripts in Jupyter notebooks."
"144","They're wrong to think that. But, on the bright side, doing data engineering for a while will help you in the long run because you will gain insights into data science that the people who take shortcuts will never have."

Oh, I'd love to hear from the great to the worst. Could you share your experience please?"
"146","It jumps out of the code when you see a good (trained) and bad (untrained) programmer. There is an art and science of programming that is immediately apparent when you look at their code. It's relatively easy to get code to ""work"" but the elegance and efficiency (and maintainablity) of the code is something else. Also, untrained programmers really can't produce complex code. Their bad practices even confuse themselves when they try to do something clever with code."
"147","Hi. I noticed that you said that people not trained in software development generally write bad code. I am in my second year of an undergrad degree in Mathematics, so I'm not being taught software development in school. Do you have any recommendations as to how I can acquire good software development skills? Are there any textbooks or other resources that you have in mind?"
"148","Can you do a class in Comp. Sci.? A programming class, taught by a computer scientist? There is a science and art of programming that is really only appreciated by specialists. It's been so long since I studied computer programming that I don't know of any contemporary resources. But I would advise being taught by a specialist and not a self-taught person.

Many scientists (statisticians, physicists, etc.) are self-taught programmers and their coding skills are poor."
"149","I agree with you, most of the information I find focuses on the pipeline, but stays away from the stats. 

I'm not sure of the stats of hiring but I imagine that people who don't know what they are actually doing are not the average hire."
"150","I even work with someone who is like this.   
She makes really great figures, but she doesn't understand the machinery behind the algorithms she uses or how they should be interpreted.  
It's too easy to pick an algorithm, generate a pretty picture and use it justify your ends."
"151","I am really trying to know how would that work. Like any algorithm we pick must be based upon what we are trying to achieve. isn't it? 

For example:
So let's say there is a huge n available p is also small and we let's say don't have care about interpretation of data but just want to predict an outcome. 

Now in that case wouldn't linear regression would be bad. A more flexible approach would produce much better predictors. So how could she decide which algo to use? I am having really hard time picturing the scenario.

And what if the variables are correlated. How do someone with no stats account for that?"
"152","Throw XGBoost at it, I imagine."
"153","More or less this, yeah. You can infinitely divide the real number line."
"154","I know this isn't the place to rant but here's something related to what you said. A friend of mine and myself graduated with PhDs in a biology field in 2017. I had already moved into a more computational subfield and had taken graduate statistical analysis courses. By the time I graduated I had about the equivalent of a masters level training in stats based on the projects I'd participated in (based on other statistician friend's evaluation).

Well jump to one year later and my friend is asking for advice about how to learn more stats. I give them some resources and next thing I know see they have finished a data science ""boot camp"" (whatever the fuck that even means) and now their LinkedIn says Firstname Lastname, Data Scientist. Holy shit, they know absolutely nothing about stats and got hired by an insurance company for their data science lead. Meanwhile, I've finished my postdoc and can't find a job in tech for the better part of 15 months. Now, as if to taunt me, I see their LinkedIn posts as they updates their progress on basic level R and Python online courses, ""Yeah! Just finished the ggplot course. Yeah! Just learned how to do linear regression! #DataScientist""

It makes my blood boil.

All these people flooding the industry with no knowledge or experience whatsoever and it's affecting the hiring of people like me who genuinely know what their talking about and are trying to make the transition to industry. I realize not all boot camps are alike and not all students are alike but this has to stop. Most companies are figuring out now that ""data scientist"" is an essentially meaninglessness term that will eventually be broken down into coherent jobs over the next decade. But in the mean time, data science will continue to be an utterly empty term that has become the new buzzword for marketing departments."

"163","DS could actually use a lot more gatekeeping precisely because of what your friend did.

&amp;#x200B;

Far, far too many people entering who never learned proper stats. Maybe I'm bitter because I sat through a bunch of lin. algebra based stats courses in grad school and then did a few years of field work before I started doing anything remotely like 'data science'. I also taught myself the theory behind ML methods rather than just learn how to import a pre-trained model and every time I hear how ""AI"" is magic and we are going to ""get the low hanging fruit with an MVP!"" it honestly makes me want to quit my job and go be a monk somewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I actually am employed with 'data scientist' as my title and I feel I'm fairly compensated but it took a long time. Not a bootcamp + a short internship. And I don't even think I'm really that good! I'm p. jealous of some of my coworker's knowledge. Thankfully the boot camp types tend to bomb out of interviews where I work just given the nature of the questions and who's typically asking them.

&amp;#x200B;

If I had to make an analogy, I feel like ""Data Science"" as a degree and doubly the bootcamps are like putting someone in a wood shop with every tool you can imagine, and teaching them how to use each tool one by one. And at the end, expecting them to be able to build an armoire even though you never taught them how to actually make anything, you just taught them how to use a saw."
"164","&gt;What I realized is that most of this programs do not actually provide  the necessary tools for doing a correct statistical analysis. They focus  on visual presentation of results and some coding (which don't get me  wrong, is quite important), but they do not teach what you actually need  to do a good project: statistical theory ( and maybe some maths to  understand the insides of the processes, but if all they do is of an  applied nature, I think this is more of secondary importance).

&amp;#x200B;

I think some of the reason for that is we have very successful kinds of models with very underdeveloped statistical theory. Successful gradient boosting algorithms are essentially simple algorithms with lots of clever engineering and heuristics. There's not a good theoretical understanding of why neural networks are able to generalize well. At the same time there's a lot of practical stuff to learn before you can use these models successfully. So people naturally focus on getting to the point where they can produce good results, which doesn't require a lot of theory.


&gt;As a result, I have seen projects which , even if they are very pretty  to look at, show a lack of understanding of some basic  ideas of  statistics, such as running an OLS regression with no or few controls in  a non-experimental setting and claiming to have found a causal  relationship between the variables.



This is not new. Before data science there were lots of highly paid professionals making bad inferences from OLS regression. The situation is probably better now that there are easily accessible communities like reddit and stackexchange where people can be told not to do that."

I think this is a critical factor that actually creates a very meaningful differentiation across different ""subareas"" of data science:

If you work for a company whose core offering isn't data science driven (e.g., not tech, not software), then data science is a secondary/auxiliary tool, and the primary philosophical you may have as a data scientist become nonsense to the key decision makers - all that matters to them is outcomes. 

Example: if you work for sales and you come up with a shitty model that is rife with statistical no-nos, but that model increases sales by 10% and is ready right now, there is no amount of statistical naysaying that is going to prevent that model from getting used unless you can come up with a model that increases sales by more.

And the issue is that sales is one of like 4 functions that both exist in virtually every company *and* are frequently the key decision makers in the company (i would argue that marketing, finance and supply chain are the other 3). So the majority of data scientists are going to be working in environments where statistical correctness is like a tertiary conocern at best."
"166","&gt;Example: if you work for sales and you come up with a shitty model that is rife with statistical no-nos, but that model increases sales by 10% and is ready right now, there is no amount of statistical naysaying that is going to prevent that model from getting used unless you can come up with a model that increases sales by more.

I mean, that's the entire point of this thread. It might not even be true that the model increases sales by 10%how do you know that it does if the modeling procedure and experimental design is rife with statistical errors?"
"167","Because, at this point, it is cheaper to run an A/B test than it is to critically design and review an experiment."
"168","You can't A/B test everything."
"169","Don't get me wrong, I think you're right in that there needs to be *some* statistical backing to making statements such as ""sales increased by 10%"".

I think there are two issues:

**In a lot of cases, the time/effort/cost of setting up an experimental design that would allow you to conclusively make that statement is prohibitive.**

Example: I worked on a project where we were testing the impact that a pricing initiative would have. We were asked to look at both the impact on margins and the impact on volume. Simple enough.

The problem is that there were so many moving variables that it was virtually impossible to control for the right variables and maintain a meaningful sample given that we were restricted to a specific geographic region for testing. If we wanted to get a clean read on the impact of the project, we would have needed to control for salesperson, customer type, purchase type, purchase frequency, assortment, specific item, channel - just to name a few. More importantly, we only had like 200 customers to work with. 

This is all on top of the fact that we worked in an industry that relied on about 15-20 other commodity markets, all of which were liable to fluctuate and impact both sales - and definitely margins. 

When you really got down to it, there were more moving parts to this project than we could reasonably control for. Which meant that no matter what type of experimental design we came up with, odds were that we were going to get an inconclusive answer.

So that's half of the equation: you literally may not be able to get a clean answer without spending a ton of time  testing - and because of the speed at which business and business innovation happens, if someone thinks the idea is good in principle and seems promising at a high level, no one is going to stand in the way of it. And that is because...

**The risk associated with rolling something out which has already been developed is normally low**

Let's say you ran some high level numbers and you find that you grew sales by 10%. You know in your statistical heart that it is really 10% +- 15%, and there are about 10 factors that could caveat that growth. But all in all, you tested the model in reality, you saw 10% growth based on some sort of simple test/control design, and the results look more positive than negative. Not good enough to bet your life that they are sustainable, but good enough to bet someone lunch that they are.

You roll out the program and it turns out that when you expand it to the full set of customers, that +10% you saw before become -1%. You find out in rolling it out that there were issues that didn't impact the initial set of customers that are a problem now. Or maybe some of the efforts required of your workforce don't scale as well. Or maybe you just got lucky during testing.

Whatever the case may be, *the cost to pivot away from this project and/or improve it to address issues is much lower than the opportunity cost of not going after 10% growth.*

To divide that into two parts:

1. When something doesn't work because of a design flaw, there are almost always process + execution considerations that can be taken in order to address that. It's rare that a concept that held water from a conceptual and testing standpoint cannot be fixed/addressed when it runs into issues.
2. Worst case scenario, you jump ship. You ax the project, take the loss, and move on. And in expectation, you're better off if 50% of the time you hit on a +10% growth project, and 50% of the time you cut your losses and move on to the next project than if you wait to have extensive enough testing to convince yourself that you are 100% going to see growth.

Again, this is not true in every industry - there are industries where, because of the speed and magnitude at which business happens (i.e., high frequency, low magnitude), you are 100% better off setting up a good testing protocol to make sure that whatever you are seeing can be as close to certainty as possible. Example: if you're Amazon and you want to roll out an improvement to your pricing engine, you 100% want to test it to the point where you are 99.99% sure that you will see positive returns, because you have the platform, business model, transaction frequency, low testing risk, high production risk combination that makes it all work out in the favor of good, fundamentally sound statistical testing.

But when you're talking about industries like B2B, with huge transaction values, low transaction frequency, largely offline sales platforms, opaque market conditions, dependencies on maybe multiple commodity markets, loooooong sales cycles, etc., then you're not going to get a nice, clean environment on which you can run such testing.

Having said all of that: I agree with you that even in those cases, it's better for someone to choose the best possible experimental design out of the options available. I have seen, even in those circumstances where there are a lot of ""as right as it's going to be"" options, people who choose the categorically wrong way to evaluate a program."
"170","You raise a lot of good points. It's true that there's many moving parts to an analysis or data science solution and that you might be unable to control for everything. But your statistical knowledge is still useful since you were able to identify these problems and eventual weaknesses of the proposed solution(s). 

Someone who just knows how to maximize AUC by any means necessary won't be able to identify these problems and their solution might look good on paper, but could be useless in reality. 

However, I'll concede that the skill set we are talking about isn't purely statistical, it's closer to general data science knowledge/experiencebut sound statistical reasoning is an important part of that skill set."
"171","&gt; Someone who just knows how to maximize AUC by any means necessary won't be able to identify these problems and their solution might look good on paper, but could be useless in reality.

Completely fair. And I have ran into people in my lifetime who presented results to leadership that were so fundamentally flawed that I had to underhandedly shoot down their whole project by escalating up my chain of command."
"172","Almost halfway through a master's degree in Data Science. Can confirm. Also, you should do a video series on how to do data science properly."
"173","Problem is you're gonna get people watching that video and then calling themselves data scientists, that's the world we live in now"
"174","My experience is that nowadays there are many people looking for becoming a ""data scientist"" (sounds catchy, right?) without wanting to learn the basics as math and stats. We all how businesses work: people want to  have some sort or tittle? Let's sale it. They take some coursera courses, some datacamp workshop and now they feel they have became a data scientist. 
Now, have you count how many online courses/YouTube videos / blogs are about data science? How they all promise to teach you? Funny is that many of them copy from each other, reproducing mistakes and of course, omitting all the proper statistical basics, all the theory. It's all really applied, no deep theory, no sustain.
It's becoming really hard to take serious the label of data scientist. I don't really know what to expect from them."
"175","Companies : ""Maybe if we get PHDs theyll be better?!?!"" How about you understand what the fuck the thing is that youre employing people for. Do most data scientists even understand what the generalization of a standard linear regression is?"
"176","Can confirm. From a consulting and data provider firm. 

I am astonished at the clear lack of understanding of basic foundations of creating quality datasets with sound methodologies and then presenting said data to an audience. 

They feel because they know the subject matter of which the data represents, that they know the data. I find this laughable because to me it's not really about what you're trying to analyse (like footballs), but how you do it and the underpinning ""science"" behind the data.

I raised this point in objection to the placing of a particular person on a data platform creation project only to be shot down because ""they know the subject matter and you don't.""

Welp. Good luck to them. It's been almost 9 months and they don't have a product. All they had to do was properly staff the project but I guess nepotism and cronyism is more NB!"

"178","I agree with all you said. Proper statistical and probability thinking is something we screen for when hiring. People will have different background and training; having a weaker statistical background can be ok if one realizes its a blind spot and seeks peers to ensure their work is done properly.

There are a lot of ways to fail and the most dangerous ones are these logic/statistical errors as they dont throw an error at you when you do them."
"179","I think it just depends on job scope, if your goal is to build software that makes predictions, little to no stats is required but visualization, programming are critical. If your designing experiments, then coding isnt necessarily as critical. Ultimately if the math someone is using isnt sound, the results will speak for themselves, event to nontechnical people"
"180","In my experience, when people learn to use basics in a few Python libraries (ex. pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn,...) they start to call themselves data scientist. And this is because of all DS courses online (there are some really good ones, but most of them is there just to be sold), which is growing industry. Now, 90% of people think that DS is Python or R and some visualizatons. The other problem is that the companies don't know much more about DS too, and we have a perfect environment for those who can sell sh** and get away with it."
"181","Machine learning is basically p-hacking to imply causality which does not really have to exist (not literally, but this is the result).

I have a PhD in Neuroscience and when I tell fellow Scientists that I am a data scientist now, they know what I mean and that it is not real science.

"185","You see, it's these kind of data wizards that believe now suddenly it is scientific. 

It's not. 

Usually your data is not retrieved in a controlled clean manner. On top of that, many data scientist ""clean"" their data sets to facilitate machine learning, which by itself is not scientific. You must have a very valid reason to remove even outliers. Removing data is highly frowned upon when doing data analysis. There is a word for it: fishing. 

You will get ""real world"" data without having had any control on any potential influences. 

When you find any sort of statistical connection between one variable and the other and it is actually causal, you were just lucky. Sure, the math shows it is ""causal"" in your data but that does not mean it is in the real world. 

It is not a mathematical problem, I am sure you know your maths/data wrangling, it is a methodological problem with the majority of data ""science""."
"186","&gt; You will get ""real world"" data without having had any control on any potential influences.

Im not a seasoned practitioner, but I feel like most data sets of interest dont give you any control. Most phenomena dont occur in an experimental setting or with any ability to control for things explicitly. I work in auto insurance. Its pretty hard to experiment with accident claims or fraud detection. To me thats kind of the fun of it. It doesnt mean I cant use statistics to better understand whats going on.

More generally, I feel like people have these stories they use to explain phenomena that the data is derived from. These stories are pretty simple and sometimes theres data that contradict them. The science part is seeing how the data matches with peoples informal stories and hypotheses. But theres a domain-specific art to creating new hypothesesnew storiesabout how the world works that better explain the data and what we see."

Code can be taught. Give me someone with a stats background and a humble approach."
"198","Not even close.

Having a working knowledge of distributed systems, writing efficient/clean code and building production systems will trump any nerd with a stats background. Most stats knowledge is abstracted anyways, read a stats 101 intro book and you're good."
"199","So is there a basic agreed upon list of what someone should know before they can call themselves a data scientist? If not can we crowdsource one here?"
"200","So is ""data science"" just ""statistics lite"""
"201","Not really fam"
"202","you're joking right?  of course. completely, each and every day.

&amp;#x200B;

"203","Two things in this post: First, data vis of Star Wars' performance on Facebook and Twitter. We got the data from the APIs and visualized it using Crowdbabble (you could also use D3 for free, if you don't mind some JavaScript coding). Second, embedding those visualizations within Sway, Microsoft's new presentation tool.

Having tried it out, I think Sway could be useful to the data scientists + visualizers here, because it's fully responsive. Rather than trapping your work in PowerPoint, and making it pretty impossible to see on mobile without a lot of zooming and pinching, you might consider Sway. They're both made by Microsoft, but Sway seems to be a lot better suited to mobile and other screen sizes. "
"204","Hey Man!
That's super cool and I can help with my Eldrazi Tron Deck and prepare a Form. 

Greetings"
"205","Eldrazi Tron form and spreadsheet created, just needs players to enter their data now :)"
"206","I just noticed that the Etron form, only has card #1 listed"
"207","Thanks, fixed!"
"208","Fantastic!!

Would you consider adding UB (Dimir) Mill?"
"209","Will do!  I'll be on a trip this weekend, leaving here soon, but will make it as soon as I get back."
"210","Sure. Enjoy your weekend!

I'm starting to think the best thing would be to create a Google Form and a copy of the spreadsheet. But I'll catch up with you when youre back.

Stay safe."
"211","I wanted to maintain a bus commute as both stops are closer to my work/home. Three times this week, I've taken the metro or an uber instead because the next bus was listed as ""schedule data"" -- which means it might come late or not at all -- or it wasn't coming for FORTY MINUTES.  On a main route.  I'm not standing in 27 degree temperature for 40 minutes to help beta-test Metro's tracker system."
"212","Yeah, bus operations/data quality definitely needs work. It's not uncommon for [\~15% of scheduled bus trips to be missing from WMATA's real-time data during weekday morning rush](https://twitter.com/dcmetrohero/status/1214584753355141120), for example. Hopefully this is something Metro and the region takes more seriously soon given [this subject is touched upon in the actions plans of the Bus Transformation Project](https://twitter.com/jamespizzurro/status/1215339818143617024), but we'll see."
"213","Who are you who are so wise in the way of science?

Seriously though, do you work in transportation, or is this just a hobby?"
"214","Lead Developer of [MetroHero](https://dcmetrohero.com) here. It's just a hobby. A really, uh, annoying hobby where you get to learn all the things wrong with transit data and operational challenges at agencies like WMATA, but can't do a whole lot about it. ="
"215","[Here is another example](https://ibb.co/1zn0G3B). Its 7 pm in Chinatown and there isnt a bus for 45 minutes. I often walk 2 miles home from work because it's faster than the bus."
"216","Buses get stuck in traffic and seem to attract more crazies than the metro. Have had numerous buses not show up at all or pass the stop completely. The drivers often are unprofessional. And a metro plus walking or uber can get you almost anywhere here without the previous mentioned annoyances."
"217","The Metro doesn't have to deal with traffic *shrug*"
"218","And the stations are warm!"
"219","I may be in the minority here, but I actually enjoy the Metrobus system. It's useful and fills in a lot of gaps that the rail system doesn't cover, and as long as BusETA is accurate (and not using ""schedule data"", which I hate because that's always bad news), it's pretty much accurate."
"220","I enjoy it when there is a bus running relatively close to my departure time. I just hate opening my bus app to see no scheduled buses or a bus in 30+ minutes."
"221","I only use the schedule if I'm leaving a station. If I'm headed to a station then use a tracking app like DC Metro Transit. Once in a blue moon there's a ghost bus but it's pretty spot on."
"222","[removed]"
"223","I mean, why pay $10 for an Uber when you can just hire a private driver to drive you everywhere. The car would be nicer and the driving would be better.

For real though, your scenario costs $16/day more. That's nearly $4,000 more per year on your commute. Most people don't have $4,000 to blow just on getting to/from work a little faster."
"224","Wow can't wait for r/washingtonDC to tell me why everything is bad and wrong about public transportation! Surely they won't whine about poor people and talk about how great Uber is!"
"225","What are you talking about? Anytime someone comes here to say something to the effect that cars are better than transit they get downvoted."
"226","Do you have the rest of your ducks in a row on your ABM strategy - good data, handoff processes and workflow between teams? 

I think intent data is good, a lot of people are relying on Bombora data. You may be better served with a sourcing + intent tool - than just an intent tool. 

I feel like ABM has been used as a buzzword for a bunch of software categories - and an excuse to charge more for unnecessary tools. I think self-reflection is really critical - and understanding where your process gaps are before buying new tools."
"227","This really helped my marketing team and I gut check. We don't have the right attribution tools in place, and decided to take that route. Bombora will be great once we have something for attribution and lead scoring in place. thank you!"
"228","You are welcome! Good luck! We are figuring this out now too. :)

Im on the marketing side and have spent a lot of time in operations."
"229","i work for a huge company and we spend so much money on bombora its useless. 


get a good marketing automation tool that you can wedge abm into. hubspot, marketo, pardot. or pay for a marketing attribution tool like bizible or terminus. 


quality abm and cheap usually dont mix AND are useless without the people who can execute properly"
"230","We're absolutely going the attribution route now. Marketing has been plagued with blind spots, so we need to start there to really understand our visitor behavior. I appreciate the thoughtful reply. We're getting a tool that offers attribution+automation+some intent data."
"231","whats your stack rn? salesforce and some entry tier MA? 


bizible is amazing for tracking your paid ad spend. marketing automation tools can sort of track paid ads but really are good for tracking activity and data from things sent out by them- not the paid ads piece. 


good luck!"
"232","just sent you a DM"
"233","I'm familiar with the offerings from Bombora and TechTarget, but not RollWorks. 

Is RollWorks leveraging bidstream intent?"
"234","No they use Bombora, Dun &amp; Bradstreet and their own data."
"235","We started using Bombora (through ZoomInfo) and the data seems accurate.  Considering we are in the beginning stages of our Intent campaign I don't have a ton of feedback yet, so look forward to hearing what others think as well."
"236","Do you happen to know how much bombora costs? What kind of intent data does it provide?"
"237","ZoomInfo for 5 users was around $33k/year and I believe the Bombora piece was $15k out of that for 12 topics (AWS, Azure, GCP, Cloud Management, CASB, Cloud Migration, etc).  I think it would be useful for specific products, but as of right now our topics are pretty much topics every organizations is or should be thinking about so I'm not sure how valuable it'll be for us."
"238","We went with RollWorks since they use Bombora and Dunn and Bradstreet. Our ICP is very, very specific so I'm looking forward to any additional visibility I can get. I'll chat you in a few months and we can compare notes."

"241","Bombora: We were quoted $17.5 for 25 topics and an additional $5k for linkedin integration."
"242","Big Data is a universe of problems that are mostly caused by size. Understand the universe of problems first. Then you can better understand how the different tools address these problems. First rule of Big Data: each tool solves a different problem and usually in a different way.

All the tools are good. None of the tools are good at everything. Tool selection begins with understanding what problems you have to solve and then finding the right tools for those problems. Spark and Cassandra might exist in the Big Data Universe, but they do very different things to solve very different problems with large data sets.

Here's a common problem with Big Data: aggregation.  If you need to add the values in one column in 100 rows of data to get a sales total for the week, any old relational database can do that nearly instantaneously. If you need to add the values in 100,000,000,000 rows, your query might not finish in a relational database before it's time to run the next week's total.

Columnar databases solve this by storing a column's values in the same data block. This is really cool. In row based storage, a single data block might have 100 rows. In columnar databases. A single row is spread across as many data blocks as there are columns in that table. If s single data block can hold 100,000 values for a single column, then adding up 100 billion values only requires 1 million I/Os to fetch all the data into memory so it can be added together. If you do the same sum on a row based table where a data block only holds 100 rows, that requires 1 billion I/Os to fetch all the data, most of which you have to throw away because you're not interested in it.

This is a really powerful way to support aggregation reports on Big Data sets. However, you cannot use it very well to find a single row. That row is scattered across (say) 50 data blocks, one for each of 50 columns in the row. Instead of an index pointing you to a single data block to retrieve a single row, it now fetches 50 data blocks. No fun.

Key idea: storage management is key to performance in large data sets.

Every Big Data tool has its trade offs. I think it will be easiest if you browse the google results for ""big data tools"" and start to internalize which problems each tool is designed to address. This will eventually arm you with a really good set of questions to ask about any tool that moves or stores data.  

Provider specific tools vs. generic tools is maybe a misleading concept. The trade offs in my experience are always workload related, meaning my workload as an engineer. Spinning up a VM running Linux in anyone's cloud gives your a place to run any tool you want, but that means installing, patching, configuring, and managing that tool. Spinning up the vendor's preconfigured tool offloads a lot of that work onto the vendor's automation, giving you more time to do your business-specific enhancements to the system. 

The good example of this would be Glue in AWS. It's built on top of Spark and is an ETL tool that is billed by cpu usage. There is no licensed ETL tool that can compete with Glue's cost. There is no home grown tool running on a VM (EC2 instance) that will be cheaper.

What are your goals in studying Big Data tools?"
"243","I don't have a goal or specific data right now. I am interested in all stages: storage, processing and analytics. 

Could you recommend a few promising/good tools provided by the three providers  for me to read more about?"
"244","I work within AWS cloud. Look at S3 and glacier. Look at Elastic Search and DynamoDB. Redshift. For relational databases, look at Aurora clusters for MySQL and Postgresql. 

Don't know why I didn't think of this earlier: watch the videos from the 2019 re:invent conference.  That will give you a great overview. Then snoop around for similar conferences from MS and Oracle."
"245","Databricks (only offered managed by Azure last time I checked) is really nice.

Ive used AWS Kinesis a bit and that whole ecosystem is really easy to work with."
"246","Do you mean Apache Spark, by Databricks that is only offered by Azure?

Does AWS also offer Spark?"
"247","Databricks is a notebook-style editor for working with Spark.

It is open source so you could build and host it yourself, but Azure offers it as a managed service."
"248","What is a service being ""managed"" and not being ""managed""?"
"249","Managed usually refers to a cloud provider hosting an application for you.

You could spin up EC2 servers and download the Databricks open source project, build it, and run it. Then youd need to have scripts in place to restart it if it crashes, and manage network permissions so it can access data.

Or, you can pay Azure for their managed Databricks offering, where they do all the above for you.

Other examples:

Any database offering

AWS Elasticsearch

GCP DataFlow"
"250","AWS is still the standard.  Azure is preferred by large companies with extensive Microsoft contracts/partnerships.  No one uses Google Cloud.

When you say ""big data""... do you mean ""large databases"", or do you mean ""hadoop""?"
"251","Uhh.. my company just signed on with GCP. Its pretty great so far."
"252","We are also all in on GCP, have been for about a year. ~50 person IT org, mostly developers.

Im in dev not data but I have no complaints."
"253","I was wondering what the data tech stack is used in your company, i.e. data tools your company is using for storage, processing and analytics?"
"254","We arent doing much around analytics yet, but we use DataFlow, PubSub, Firestore, and BigQuery."
"255","Thanks. Do you have candidates for analytics tools in mind?"
"256","I was wondering what the data tech stack is used in your company, i.e. data tools your company is using for storage, processing and analytics?"
"257","Going through a few POCs now to determine the best route. 

We are storing raw data in google storage (GCP version of aws S3). We load critical reporting data into BigQuery for reporting and analytics. Still deciding on what to use for ETL (dataproc vs dataflow vs data fusion vs custom solution using spark on gke. These services are similar to EMR or AKS in Amazon). 

A lot depends on your companies needs and resources. If you are strapped for resources, managed services such as gcp BigQuery/aws redshift, gcp cloud sql/aws rds, etc maybe the way to go. If you have the resources, it might be more efficient in the long run to build out a data platform on top of kubernetes.

All three providers have pros and cons, and all three can help your team build highly effective data pipelines. I highly recommend having a deep understanding of the tools and services you plan to use before diving in. Jumping into big data in the cloud unprepared can lead to enormous costs and challenges. Try to take your time and get it done correctly and as future-proof as possible."
"258","Well yeah, so much available capacity!"
"259","I was always under the impression that google firebase and big query were popular services."
"260","Google has one of the biggest databases when it comes to Big Data. Saying that nobody uses shows how incompetent you are.

All Google products use analytics. Google analytics is what makes YouTube profitable. Google does mine a lot of data as well, but it is widely used in the market when it comes to AI and analytics.

BigTable, BigQuery, are widely used in the GCP world.

I think companies are just behind when it comes to bigdata."
"261","&gt; BigTable, BigQuery, are widely used in the GCP world.

Widely used in the GCP World... and what a little world it is."
"262","Tools related to big data, including storage (databases, distributed file systems), processing and analytics. Can be generic (existing outside the cloud providers) or specific to cloud providers. Popular or promising not falling out of favor or being replaced."
"263","hmm so twice as fast spreading as swine flu and 2-3 times as deadly"
"264","Swine didn't stop growing, I personally don't know why right now

But yes, in terms of speed relative to what the nCov has reached in numbers thus far, yes.

The r0 and death% tells a different story though."
"265","Your title is misleading. It's as if you were trying to prove that soft skills are more important than hard skills in your hypothesis. The correct way would be to say ""An example of why communication skills matter more than technical skills in certain cases"". Even then, I'd rather say they are complementary to each other."
"266","Agree, I'd go as far as to call them synergistic in the literal sense. The sum of their products is far greater than either on their own. I've always maintained that the best data scientists I've worked with were greatly enabled by their people skills. In my recent role, I worked with two guys: a data analyst that had incredibly impressive technical chops but no people skills, and a data scientist that didn't have as great technical skills (relatively speaking), but felt comfortable getting out there, building relationships, understanding the business, and building domain specific knowledge.

The analyst just couldn't understand why he was having so much trouble getting the data scientist role. He put so much effort into the technical aspect, and was brilliant, but you could not take this guy anywhere. He provided no value if not in front of his computer. He was a bit of an extreme example so don't take it as me inferring that everyone here is socially inept. But you get the point.

I find a lot of us here focus so heavily on learning stats, programming, machine learning, etc. yet we overlook doing some of the things that are actually uncomfortable and not as natural to us. Toastmasters, leadership development, presentations--you don't have to become the best at these things, but man just getting better at them will have a tremendous impact. My opinion anyways."
"267","On the flip side, we had DSwith few tech skills, but could sell ice cream to a person of Inuit decent. He was very capable of explaining quantitiative concepts, and oversold many clients bc he lacked the skills necessary to properly process and analyze the data to know its limitations. He ended up costing the company boatloads of money in not just legal fees (after we got sued by 2 separate clients), but also in lost revenue and the costs incurred by a damaged reputation. Too many experts in pivot tables convince themselves that tech skills are overrated, and that they can be a DS. If you want to succeed, my opinion is that you have to have a healthy tech background coupled with above average presentation abilities, and of course advanced research and statistical acumen. There are no short cuts- at least in the long run."
"268","That's true. You can't edit titles though. I did not think too much about it and wanted to illustrate the fact that you can go a long way with simple tools. 

Obviously you won't cure cancer with beautiful charts."
"269","Redacting skills and at least minor sense of aesthetics is where its at."
"270","I don't think this is an either or thing.

This is like debating which is more important - the gun or the bullet."
"271","Good article and good point for discussion. I agree with the previous comments though, that it isn't appropriate to say communication skills matter more than technical ones, but I do agree they are deeply complementary. Data analysis without communication is pointless."
"272","One more thing which is important is critical thinking, for example not comparing very different things.

You could also say that this guy helped more than NASA, for example.

&amp;#x200B;

(the article is great by the way)"
"273","As far as I know, the NASA has not released any PR about them helping the fight against Coronavirus."
"274","Yes. Because neither NASA, nor Deepmind are about this"
"275","They have tried to tackle the the virus problem with Deepmind (https://www.businessinsider.com/google-deepmind-ai-predictions-coronavirus-2020-3?op=1&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T). 

Your point is fair that even though they are tackling the same problem (Coronavirus), the solution they are providing are very different. 

I don't think that it does not invalidate my point that good communication with simple stats can have greater impact. Obviously there are things that good communication can not solve and that advanced ML can."
"276","It's funny because I thought that same exact thing as I read it Wed. Great point."
"277","Fact is communication skills are a lot easier to hone than technical skills. Technical skills are always more time intensive so that's what everyone focuses on. Not to say that communication doesn't play a huge role. It does. It's just easily overlooked like most soft skills for that reason."
"278","If you stay in the weeds, you'll stay in the weeds.  Communication skills allow you to progress in a career far beyond being the best technically.  Not equating this to happiness but more towards a higher monetary value position.  Unless of course you work for Google and you're part of the million dollar engineer club."
"279","Anyone else on their phone who also thought the graph was a hair on their screen when scrolling down?"
"280","It seems to me like you lack an understanding of tech"
"281","You need a portfolio then and start presenting to get your skills in front of hiring managers locally. 

Basically, youre missing the problem solving and storytelling aspect so pick some problems and show what you can do. Its partly easier to teach those skills than technical skills anyways. Your manager can tell you what to do to start off anyways. 

I hired some like this recently, who did not like getting a beginner offer but its company policy. And it made sense. In a year theyll be up to speed and will warrant a salary increase but the workload right now will be on me as well as them."
"282","Thanks. I figured that would be the way the salary would work. But what should I put in my portfolio? Which problems to pick?"
"283","Pick something of interest to you. If you're feeling adventurous find something related to the company you're interviewing/applying with. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, applying for health care, show something related to population health data - where in the county is worse or better? Or a basic visualization?

For Finance? Show something related to the analysis of stock or market data depending on the role. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ideally you do not want to use a data set that's everywhere, such as Iris, cars or titanic."
"284","Thanks. Yeah, I did Titanic just to learn. But I can start to pick stuff that is a bit more interesting and eye-catching."
"285","Keep working on your programming skills. If you know some python already then focus on pandas. I use pandas for every single data science project that I'm working on. Then from there, start learning the machine learning techniques. Then do a couple personal projects or kaggle competitions to apply the things you've learned.

"286","Thanks! I did the Titanic kaggle, both using linear regression as well as a neural network. I'll continue with the pandas, they seem very useful."
"287","If you're having trouble and you don't have a grad degree, two good paths are to first get an internship or first get a job as a data analyst."
"288","I'm already interning for company now as data scientist in Tunisia, but I got this job because of referrals not because of my experience and I aim to find a DS job in Europe. Do you think its feasible to find an internship or to land a data analyst  in my case?"
"289","Great, you're on a good track then. I think it is, but I'm in the US so I don't know  about the European job market."
"290","Im in Europe and its feasable, at least the internship. It depends on the market. Here in Northern Europe the DS market is a little saturated, lots of companies went all in and got Data Scientists and have now realized they dont have the infrastructure in place to support them so are buying up Data Engineers like mad."
"291","hey it's a good start ! Now you should focus on getting as much experience and knowledge from this internship

if you're not too low on money and hardworker I also recommend to take a few month gap for personal projects !"
"292","An employment gap on a resume is always questionable"
"293","is it really if you have never worked as an employee but as an intern ? I don't know I'm a student too !"
"294","If you are in school during that gap, no. But any time there is time on a resume where you aren't employed that isn't explained on the resume, it could be a concern for some."
"295","That's a shame since personal projects are usually the most instructive and the most interesting for employers : it really shows how someone's able to work with self-government and ones ability to imagine and think on his own. Although I feel like personal projects don't belong in the CV (but rather in an interview)

Thanks for your advices"
"296","What if you are having trouble *AND also* have a grad degree. I have both biostat and BME degrees and will be graduating spring witb an MS

I am still having lot of trouble and I have never had an internship or job before. Most internships in this field wont take me bc I am graduating


I wonder if its because my software eng skills are weak"
"297","That's normal too. Getting the first job is supposed to be the hardest. I can only speak for US, but I graduated with my MS in Physics and didn't get a job straight out of it. I ended up doing a (low paying) internship in the summer, which I got partially from the help of a reference. I started looking again in July, applied to 100 jobs, interviewed, and landed my job in October. Again, my ability to get an interview was largely dictated by whether I had a reference (5/100 apps got me interviews, in 4 had a reference).

As for having a software engineering background, I'm sure experience there is really helpful. If you lack there it may help to work on some projects and put them on GitHub? Your background is solid, I'm sure you can make it if you keep pushing."
"298","Do projects, build a portfolio, have a body of work that can demonstrate your skills in lieu of experience"
"299","There are three key areas of knowledge of an effective data scientist (defined as someone who analyses data and codes models): programming, math (stats for most businesses), and business itself. Considering many in data science come from CS / STEM backgrounds, often one only hears about the former two - and it is great if the company has data science at the core of its business model. Unfortunately, most businesses do not. In order to identify problems and create applied solutions, business understanding is essential. Hence my answer would be that unless you go to work for a company that already has an established and internally valued data science team (where you can learn about the business on the job), do not start as a data scientist.  For other careers, pick a business that you like, pick good management, and possibly even a place where technology is underappreciated. Why? You will e.g. write an easy predictive model for product sales, and you'll become a star."
"300","Seems like an interesting tip, thanks man !"
"301","Good luck!"
"302","Depends on your background. If you have a PhD in physics, id go directly for data scientist. If you have a bachelor's in international affairs, I'd try to get a job as a database developer or data analyst first"
"303","In my case, I'm a CS major, I've done couple of internships (a ds internship that I'm still enrolling in as a part of my degree and a web dev internship)."
"304","If you can get a ML Eng job, that is a really good path."
"305","I agree with this. Demonstrating that you can write big boy code, can build sensible data pipelines, and understand how to integrate common ML algorithms should honestly be starting work for every data scientist. So many I've worked with just copy/paste SVM or whatever, put up a nice confusion matrix, and call it a day. Digging into the parameters or scaling the work to a large data set causes blank stares. In short, ""data scientist"" is a watered down job title, imo, so differentiate yourself with engineering work. My other advice is to be a lifelong learner. Best of luck to you."
"306","&gt;  In short, ""data scientist"" is a watered down job title, imo

Data Scientist can mean 2 things:

""Advanced Business Analyst"" or ML Engineer

There's a totally different domain out there under the Data Engineer job title that overlaps with ML Engineer. Just my opinion of course."
"307","++ for life long learner"
"308","Agreed. I'm a fairly high profile data scientist for one of the biggest companies in the world and there is plenty space on the stage. It'd be much easier to climb the engineering ladder to the top compared to the software side. Primary comparison is that the best systems engineers AREN'T systems engineers. They come with some background. A BS/MS in systems... Even systems engineers with PhDs are laughed right into middle management and will go no where from that point on. That's where data science is going. It's not there yet but the better data scientist understand the data first."
"309","I don't know much about the DS job market outside of the US, but I would go ahead and try for a DS job. If it doesn't work out try for a analyst role"
"310","Okay thanks for the tips!"
"311","What if you are a bachelor in physical affairs?

*10,000 tomatoes unleashed*"
"312","What do you mean by the If you have a PhD in physics go directly to data scientist sentence ?"
"313","Data science jobs are very competitive. Ideally you would have data science work experience. If not, you still need something to differentiate yourself at the resume stage. An advanced degree in a quantitative field might do that."
"314","Tips for getting a data analyst job? I have a BS in applied stats and know R, Python, SQL and even base SAS. However I've been applying to many data analyst and similar jobs without any luck."
"315","What's your location?"
"316","California"
"317","It's a numbers game for the first job. Just apply to as many as you can. Go to networking events."
"318","Create some projects and place them on a github repository, then include it in your CV/cover letter. That'll put you ahead of most candidates with no experience."
"319","You lack experience in industry where data science is used . Being an analyst is a more reasonable job position for a new bachelor level grad without experience 

You are missing business knowledge - that is the most valuable thing that sets data scientists apart when it comes to landing a position .

A 1 year analyst in oil and gas industry is a better candidate for a data science position in an oil and gas company than someone off the street.

Apply to any data analytical and DS parallel positions to gain business knowledge and move into a formal DS role 

- this is just my opinion -"
"320","Do you know for certain your preference is on the analytics side?  You can also try for an MLE job instead of DS, depending on what you would enjoy.

The job path, if not jumping into the desired role initially, is: analyst -&gt; data scientist or software engineer -&gt; machine learning engineer.

Though, there are always exceptions.  I went from SE to DS many years ago.  This requires luck more than anything imho because companies do not hire DSs who have previously worked as an SE.  You need an internal project at a company that lets you transfer teams usually."
"321","And what is the highest paying job among these all ?"
"322","What kind of pay?  In happiness and not hating your life?

In cash, MLE, as they're usually needed at large companies.  They say DS pays more than SE but out here in the sf/bay area I often find SEs being paid equal and sometimes above DSs.  MLE, DS, and SE all are paid a similar rate.  Analyst is the exception and can be paid 1/2 to 1/3rd of the other titles."
"323","Hahaaha, but which career you'd hate yourself the most in since you mentioned that"
"324","I did a gig as a software engineer and hated it.  I learned and grew a lot!  I stopped being self conscious about my programming skills.  Today I'd easily qualify as a senior or principal software engineer if I wanted, which is pretty rare on the DS side of things.

I find the opposite is true for many people and they like being an SE better.  Some people just like building things and some people like discovering unseen patterns in datasets.  Some like both.

I can tell you on the MLE side, PyTorch is well received but if you want to work at Google you'll need to know Tensorflow.

You'll find what you like by doing hobby projects.  That and classes.  Eg, MIT has a data science 101 class you can take and see if you like.  Though, I find projects to be a better indicator."
"325","Why not just farm out your resume to all data related jobs and make a decision on who bites? Data analyst, data engineer, data scientist, reporting analyst..etc"
"326","Can you elaborate, I don't understand?"
"327","Submit your resume to 100 companies see who bites"
"328","Or in some cases *9000!!!*"
"329","the motto I've lived by is "" you get what you go for"", Its worked out well so far."
"330","Vicky Boykin, a respected Data Scientist in our field, has written an exact blog post for your question. I encourage you to read it:

http://veekaybee.github.io/2019/02/13/data-science-is-different/"
"331","Thoroughly enjoyed reading it :) Good advice for junior data scientists."
"332","Is it possible for a psychology graduate to start a job as a data scientist, or perhaps relevant occupation ?"
"333","Depends. Where are you based?

If your psychology education was anything like in Europe (at a university) you would have extensive experience with:

- Setting up research (questions)
- Conducting experiments (experimental design) and which features could measure which outcomes.
- Thinking about data gathering and analysis
- Interpreting numbers and graphs related to statistical analysis
- Decent stats knowledge. (I.e. you've had the basics relating to ANOVA/LinReg/LogReg/PCA. Best case scenario: CFA/EFA/SEM. Between/within group ANOVA's (can be compared to clustering). Model selection/model evaluation/feature selection. (Even though most of psychological statistics is very classical, knowledge of the above makes transitioning to ""Machine Learning"" very easy, especially since ML/AI is just a fucking buzzword.
- Problem solving skills related to the above.
- Scientific philosophy and critical thinking.

Then apart from the above you would probably need to be comfortable with some form of programming language (Python/R/SQL), and basics of machine learning experimental design (train-test split, etc).

Since Data Science is a very ill-defined term (broadly speaking) you could have more luck at less technologically advanced companies. You might consider them less prestigious, but honestly who cares if it gets your foot in the door.

Do notice that most of the people commenting on reddit concerning requirements for data science are from a very STEM heavy background or CS background. This makes their advice most of the time ill-suited for most businesses that want analysts/scientists (in a lot of companies analysts do the same work as data scientists, just under a different title.) Those comments would most likely focus on things like ""you need linear algebra, calculus, optimization, discrete math and w/e"". Let's face it, at most companies you won't use that straight away. There are so many companies which are not at a decent ""data maturity level"".

Advice: get a junior position somewhere with an established team so you can get domain knowledge. At the end of the day if you know a lot of maths but cant deliver business value, your boss is not going to like you. And delivering business value is a lot harder considering you have to speak to stakeholders who don't know their nose from their ass when it comes to what they want to know."
"334","Thanks for your reply, in Malaysia we do have research method and analysis subject for every semester as my campus follow the UK syllabus, I did learn about the basics (anova, linear regression etc) and learned to analyse data using SPSS, but I believe my understanding is still at a shallow level.. 

As for R, Python Ive been learning on coursera to develop some basics skills and get a professional certificates, however idk if its recognised by organisations. 

Basically you are right, getting my foot in the door is the first step and local organisations often prioritise CS, AS and CE students, so right now Im focussing on online courses hope it will help with my application."
"335","I dont understand what you mean by more logical. If you want to be a data scientist, pursuing data science positions is the most direct path to that."
"336","Most of the data science jobs I found require data analytics, big data, sql .. job experience. I got the impression that it is hard to get a DS job without an experience ( I am a CS major).  So I thought maybe its smarter to gain work experience with fields that compliments data science first, then apply for DS position with more qualifications."
"337","Youll see listings that want experience, graduate degrees, etc. its not unheard of (or uncommon) to take an entry-level position as a data analyst before pivoting to full DS. Just get as close as you can to what you want and fine tune from there."
"338","Okay, thank you!"
"339","If you see skills on every job posting youre looking at then get that experience. You might not have a job to cite but you can always work on a project and put it on github and a medium post. 

And if you dont know SQL then go learn it. Its fairly easy and I wouldnt bring in anyone, even a beginner data analyst, without some proof they could use it. Also, go learn Excel. Spreadsheets are a much more powerful tool than they get credit for."
"340","I already have a good base in CS, databases, big data, python .. Currently I'm learning ML and DL and the math, I'm working on projects in that field that I'm going to put on github as well.

When companies say they need work experience in a technology they do not mean that someone hired you to use it, they mean that you've done project using it? Is that what you mean? Thanks!"
"341","Just following up because I didnt see you specifically address it, are you experienced in SQL? Ill echo the parent comment that its absolutely a necessity in my experience (having hired several intern positions and entry level positions in data science and analytics for my company)."
"342","Yeah yeah, in the CS degree we studied databases quite deeply (mysql and oracle), and I've applied what I learnt in several projects of mine"
"343","Job descriptions are boilerplate. Asking for job experience is standard. Having said that, theres a difference between understanding from a class and understanding from experience, especially when it comes to doing real deep analysis. A lot of data science is now very engineering heavy where you dont need as much analytical skill to understand the problem as you do technical skill to optimize a model but much more is still focused on having the skill set to take an abstract, incomplete, and bug-ridden data set and returning actionable insights. That last skill is hard to get in school and an independent non-academic project is one way of signaling that you have that skill."
"344","Yeah I kinda get that, I am working on improving myself on that part. But there's not much resources addressing that ( cleaning messy data ). I'm already interning in a local company in a DS role, they gave me a database with 3 millions rows and they are asking me to build a model that predicts sales of each product for the next year, and I can say that the data is messy and there is a lot of errors, missing data and stuff like that, but I didn't find many resources on how to correct that."
"345","That's amazing training. You'll learn the truth about data science: 80%+ of the effort isn't in model selection or fancy analysis, its in understanding and cleaning your data. Its frustrating and can make you hate yourself or your chosen profession at time but its incredibly important.

When I interview people, one of the question I often ask is how they'd approach a bug-laden data set. By the end of your internship you'd be qualified to provide an answer, which is something a lot of your peers who won't get a similar experience won't have. Good luck, its gonna suck sometimes."
"346","Well yeah probably hahaha, but do you have any good resources on learning to do that effectively ? And btw, thanks for the tips :D !"
"347","With data cleaning, the best way to learn is to do. I don't actually know some resources but googling missing, corrupted, incomplete, buggy, etc. data should get some good starting points. Then, as you encounter issues in your internship check the internet for similar things."
"348","Dude, your internship experience will be quite valuable, you just have to present it well in your resume, making sure to highlight whatever you've learnt. I'm in a similar situation like you (CS undergrad, graduating in 2020) and I've been applying to a lot of companies asking for ML engineers, and I think that's the best way to start a career in DS. Gaining experience in the field in whatever way is possible. 

And talking about missing data, see if any of the basic pandas  techniques work for you (assuming you use python)."
"349","And how is that working for you, did any of the companies respond ?"
"350","Not really, but I'm hopeful. I already have a job in one of my country's biggest IT companies, where I currently intern, but I can't be sure if I'll get an AI/ML related role when I join full-time later this year. I also applied to one of Omdena's challenges, for experience. They help you learn a lot in Data Science, and you get experience working on a real world project."
"351","Best of luck man, hopefully you'll get the job you are looking for!"
"352","I may offer another insight: when deciding between offers you should simply choose the company with the better fit for you. Even if you don't work as DS, you will still gain experience and also money and also networking and also change your living situation etc. It's a great start anyway."
"353","Hi, Yes I think this would be possible. I would recommend starting of as a backend engineer and then moving into specializations like ML engineer or Full stack engineer depending on your interests. 

For the back end engineer the basic requirements would be:

1. Algorithms and data structures (I recommend getting enough practice from leetcode, etc they have learning paths which can be very helpful) This is usually where most engineers fail in the interview

2. General understanding of web systems, like what is a front end? what is a back end? how do they communicate with each other?, since you have experience with Python I would recommend looking at flask its easier to get started on

3. Understanding databases, like SQL CRUD queries, joins, views, OLTP data modelling

4. Docker, most companies currently use docker for their apps 

5. Optional: kafka, OLAP database (AWS redshift, etc) not all companies use this but would be good to know what these are

hope this helps. Please let me know if you need more specifics. Good luck :)"
"354","Thanks! I guess I hadnt considered a switch to back end developer, as its rather a large career jump. I feel like most companies wouldnt want to hire an ex DS PhD, or I would have to take a giant pay cut. I might be totally pulling that out of thin air though! Otherwise I feel like it makes sense as a clean break from DS and gets me right into the thick of software development."
"355","u/doctor_of_space  are right about the paycut you will have to take :( . I am not so sure about companies not willing to hire ex DS PhD's as a backend engineer, I have seen a few of these. Another option would be (depending on your ""big data/ spark/ NLP, ML"" expertise) is to look of a ML engineer or Data Engineer I think this might give you the interesting challenges involved in working with large amounts of data, the ability to flex your DS skills and not take a huge pay cut as these positions are usually closer in salary range to DS."
"356","Option 2 is great advice, imo. Your DS qualifications becomes one of your benefits in a role like that."
"357","IMHO, with a PhD you would not want to be a back-end engineer and I think you might be bored. What you really want is to find a place where your capacity and background (math, whatever) are utilized in a way that you can work on algorithm design, proofs of concepts and maybe get into the nitty-gritty of a particular implementation of something interesting. There are jobs in Fintech that match this description, maybe some select DoD work, robotics, blockchain.... Back when I worked in the financial industry, we had a department staffed with PhDs and most of them came from either physics or math. They worked on some super secret trading stuff (stochastic calculus based). The entry into the group wasn't conditioned on knowledge of things like Kafka or Spark or C or Python (those are just tools any monkey can learn) - it was assumed that with an advanced technical degree those would be easy to pick up. However, not any monkey can pick up advanced calculus, complicated geometry etc. etc."
"358","Hmm do you think it would be possible to get considered for these positions with just a bachelor's in electrical engineering?"
"359","I don't think so."
"360","With *only* the degree, probably not.

However, a LOT of computer engineers have electrical engineering degrees. In addition, a lot of electrical engineer jobs involve significant amounts of software development.

As a specific example, Im a computer engineer with both CompE and EE degrees, and I develop CPU simulators, analyze data from them and real systems using data science techniques and tools, as well as build our infrastructure with DevOps tools.

I also know a TON of EEs that decided to switch from hardware to software. They usually made moves after they had 2-5 years experience that included SWE work in their EE job."
"361","lol not a chance."
"362","Damn >#"
"363","I work in finance.  At the firm I'm at (a very large hedge fund you've definitely heard of), and at one of the previous firms I was at (similar), we would sometimes/often hire science PhDs for coding positions.   So-called ""quant devs"".  Guys who can code but also know math.  It's really (really) hard to hire people who know how to code very well but also know math well, so we pay them handsomely.

There's definitely a very lucrative market for those types of folks.  You probably don't need any additional formal education.  Just learn to code well - python and C++.   Especially C++.    Science phd + solid C++ skills == unicorn status.   No need for more school.  Just learn C++ really well and spend a lot of time on LeetCode (as much as you can stand and then some).  

I'm actually trying to hire someone like this now and it's proving to be a huge pain in the ass despite the fact that we pay through the nose."
"364","For such quant jobs, how can one gain the necessary skills after graduating with a MS in some computational program without doing a full PhD?"
"365","you mean to be a quant dev, or a researcher?  i'll assume you mean QD.  in that case, just study C++ so you know the language pretty well (understanding how memory management works, including types of pointers, or how objects are initialized, virtual functions, how templates work, etc) , but also knowing algorithms, which isn't really a C++ issue, just an algorithms issue.   for the former, just read C++ books and practice coding.  for the latter, spend a lot of time on LeetCode.  it wouldn't hurt to know linux reasonably well too.  nobody really programs on windows in finance - it's 99% linux.

when you go to apply, make sure ""knows C++ and algorithms"" is featured prominently in the description in some form or other.   also, list all the math courses, ML libraries or whatever else relevant you know.  make sure it's obvious you know some math, even if you're not a hardcore researcher.   

there's no secret to it - just know your stuff.  reading. (e.g., C++ primer, 5th edition), practice projects and LeetCode."
"366","Thanks for the tips!"
"367","A coworker of mine is almost done transitioning into a SWE role. Here is her gradual progression 

Data scientist -&gt; data engineer -&gt; 
ML engineer -&gt; SWE

So she went from modeling based DS role to a spark heavy DE role. From there she was able to deploy models to the stack as a ML eng. And after building enough experience there the switch to SWE was possible.

Not the only road from A-&gt;B but it worked out for her"
"368","This is definitely an approach I have thought about, albeit mostly just DS -&gt; DE -&gt; SWE, so skipping the MLE side. Definitely an issue I see arising is the amount of technical work for me decreasing, however. This is mostly due to a strong push for people in my current company to take on leadership roles as well as my strong communication skills. Unfortunately I dont really enjoy that and would much rather be doing technical work. Perhaps trying to switch over more to a DE role would be a good idea then."
"369","Same. I was an officer in the navy. I absolute hate being in situations where youre accountable for technical details on 10-15 projects at a time but your only access to it is at the 10k foot level. Seemingly, no question was off limits and you never felt comfortable with your knowledge.

I much prefer to be hands on making technical/design decisions and not just memorizing superficial details to appease upper management."
"370","Dang that last part sums up my position at the moment. As much as I love getting hands on in the projects and presenting them, its a mine field that takes almost as much effort to traverse sometimes"
"371","If you dont want an emphasis on leading and communicating, Start telling people to go f*** themselves and stuff, it worked for me and now Im nice as can be!"
"372","I'd be curious what pushed her from ML engineer -&gt; SWE.  Any chance you could put me in touch?"
"373","Good lord you shouldn't have to go back to school to do software development/engineering.

You should be able to self-study your way into a position.

Brush up heavily on data structures and algorithms. You will probably find this one of the more enjoyable areas, but I could be wrong. It's my personal favorite area of CS. Unfortunately, in the real world, you don't really mess too much with these in a hands-on way. You'll usually implement something that already exists, although there are plenty of edge cases where more custom-made stuff is used. And of course, knowing WHAT to implement, even if it exists already, is as important as being able to make custom stuff.

Also brush up heavily on design patterns. These are usually well-understood and efficient design patterns used in production environments. They generally are used because they either represent a ""best practice"", are easily handled by teams of people working in a project at the same time, or both.

Databases. I suspect you have some familiarity with them as a DS person, but maybe not. If not, SQL time."
"374","To second this opinion, I also found learning to implement classic data structures helpful."
"375","It very much depends on what you would want to do with CS since there are a plethora of avenues you could go down. Each one varies but the core concepts are universal. But as for c/c++ and python those are highly in demand everywhere. Fortran not so much to my knowledge. C/C++ tends toward embedded development and python towards research, in ML DS and many other fields. It all depends what you want to do, weather it be research or software development. Web dev in and of itself has front end and back end development that varies. There is also just writing test code for other projects too. So definitely slowly dive into things and see what you like, each has it's own downsides and upsides."
"376","Web development is the most boring thing ever so be careful."
"377","I know lol my researching ml stuff rn and plan to do that indefinitely"
"378","stay strong man you can do it"
"379","&gt;I understand that those skills probably not what would be in demand

C++ and Python will get you very far. 

Instead of doing another degree, why not do some self study on computer science topics where you find your knowledge lacking?

Compilers, operating systems, database systems, computer architecture, numerical analysis, formal logic systems, etc. would be a good start. Just look up the coursework from MIT's OCW and that should keep you busy for a while.

Is there any particular professional stream that you want to enter into? Are you going for a role in industry or in academia? What kind of problems interest you?

I would also find some open source software projects and learn how to contribute to a community with a codebase that you want to advance using technologies that you want to work with for tools that solve problems that interest you."
"380","These are good suggestions, thanks. I honestly dont know what role Im thinking of, it was a big enough change to end up in DS that I havent considered that. Definitely industry of some kind though. I like your comment about the open source contributions, Ill give that some thought!"
"381","Something that you can start doing is taking on more and more engineering tasks -- deploying the models, setting up APIs, getting your hands dirty with infra tooling. 

While these can sound daunting and even boring tasks, you'll soon find out that there are plenty of problems at the intersection of DS and engineering that don't have great out of the box solutions, or even remotely well-established practices. To name a few, low-latency model serving, model life-cycle management, model monitoring, data drift detection, etc. are fairly interesting topics that you could start exploring and forming an expertise around. 

Given your background, getting hired to work in interesting problems won't be an issue. Just poke around your organisation (or hell, even open-source) for unmet needs that require engineering solutions and you'll surely find plenty of stimulation work that goes beyond just doing classic web/CRUD development. 

Be prepared for leetcode style interviews though!"
"382","Data engineer for sure. It's a good blend between skills you have and skills you want. Transitioning from there to full blown dev is pretty straightforward. 

I've worked in data (not completely DS) for about 7 years. I'm slowly moving towards full-stack development and devops.

I wouldn't worry about taking much of a pay cut or finding employment. You have the framework already."
"383","I am somewhat in the same boat with you. I am ""forced"" into making a switch from DS to SWE due to the needs in my company. Simply more Software development work is required than analytical work at the stage our company is in.

While SWE work is quite fun, it is just sad to see DS skill which we have built for months wasted away."
"384","Your company does not own you :-)"
"385","Try applying at FANG. Your CV seems interesting for them. Practice coding interview  and you will be fine."
"386","Youre a PhD. Take a couple coursera courses and watch some YouTube videos. Get a job, learn, and move on. The less school the better for CS."
"387","I respectfully disagree that less school is ""better"". I taught my self programming, and then entered a university program, and then kept teaching myself while working at different positions. The self-teaching and the formal coursework are both useful in complementary ways. That said, going back to school probably isn't necessary for many people who are already working. (One of my colleagues never finished his undergraduate degree, and is a quality software engineer.)"
"388","I would agree at lower levels, but when youve gone to 9 years of secondary and post secondary school, id say your ability to learn is adequate to teach yourself what you need to learn without adding debt. 

I went to 2 semesters of a 6 semester masters degree and dropped out. I learned the rest of what I needed on the job. 

(Edit) felt like I needed to clarify. I took interviews after my first semester with stuff fresh in my mind and got an offer and then dropped out. Wasnt a case of Im too good for this more of a case of new employer did not pay for masters, old one did.

You will learn how to learn CS in a degree. CS today is less algos and data structures and more reading documentation and stitching APIs and Libraries together. I would say OP is more than capable of reading documentation and applying it after completing a PhD."
"389","hahaha.

I am almost done a Neuroscience PhD (recording and analyzing signals from the brains of behaving rats), so I can't disagree with you about evidence of learning how to learn. (Research funding pays for education.)

Learning new stuff that somehow falls under the broad umbrella of ""information processing"" (biological or engineered) is a short summary of my overall educational and professional history.

Our CS courses involved building classic data structures as classes in C++ and then essentially implementing a spreadsheet like program with our classes underneath MFC GUI interfaces. Then we had to learn things like digital logic design, build a small microprocessor, program it, write a function in assembly to boost performance in a C class, implementing a buffer overflow attack, higher level computer architecture, building threaded classes, discrete math, mucking around in the Linux operating system components to perform various tasks and re-implementing classic artificial intelligence designs. I wouldn't have learned a comprehensive picture of the systems from top to bottom without the whole package."
"390","I suggest you have a chat with people in the field who are working in industries from CS background. It seems obvious to follow interest and hence ask for reaource and courses. Not saying it is wrong but perhaps its not a good option as we all have bias. Write your questions down from this post and start to research people from friends, or people you dont know.write them nice emails. ask for contacts. 

more interview, better clear picture you can get.

I'm similar to your but not holding Phd. I'm applying for MS CS. Before applying, I keep asking myself that do I really need one?  

Initially, I have researched for a long time on web dev coding bootcamp and can confirm the nature of commercialization make them skip the core understanding of CS. By that mean, do you want to become chef or just cook?  Dont get me wrong. Coding bootcamp has their place but I dont want to say 'they didnt teach me' , when my boss asks me to do sth or I am going to solve my business problem.

I've talked one coach and I've not asked for my friends. I'll do this gradually."
"391","Ive actually been interested in the same or similar transition since last year and started to take undergrad CS courses at a local university. I dont think you need to do the same but I did find that I was able to learn topics like Data Structures more easily in a classroom environment."
"392","I'm in the middle of making this same transition.  I started the OMSCS program to help facilitate.  I think my first step out will probably be something like a data engineer.  Thugh I'd love to leap straight to SWE I just don't think it's doable."
"393","I totally agree with your path. Either that or MLE if possible, get enough experience there and then make the full switch."
"394","You could become an Applied Scientist at a FAANG. Great pay.  


Enter as a Data Scientist if you aren't strong at programming and then transition within a year."
"395","I mean that would be the dream, ideally. One of those or Microsoft or just a big tech in general. I know Microsoft and Amazon sometimes hire where I am, Charlotte, but the location could hurt me, as I cant really move anytime soon."
"396","This is more of a personal request, but for the love of God, learn to write clean, readable code. I've worked with some really brilliant data scientists, much smarter than I'll ever be, but none of them wrote legible code. 

*The Pragmatic Programmer* is a great book on practical coding techniques."
"397","1. Cloud/Infrastructure/DevOps. Depending on your team, I personally have to do all of this. Data infrastructure is sufficiently different enough from application that it's typically self managed by the team. We use Terraform, Packer, Docker, Ansible, Buildkite, Docker etc. 
2. Writing clean and performant code. Analysis is typically a solitary job focusing on a single task at a time, and the code is seldom reusable. Therefore there is little incentive for analysts/DS to care if other people can understand the code, or things like modularity, naming, efficiency, tests. And they are right to not to. But this won't fly in DE.
3. Deep knowledge in the language/DSL(e.g. Spark) itself, rather than just using it as a tool. I can't articulate this very well, as the language is ""just a tool"" for the results you want to achieve everywhere. It's just that when I'm doing machine learning, language is little more than a way to use ML specific libraries. I switched from R to Python just because  Python had certain bindings to frameworks that is much better than R's. When becoming a de, I realised that I didn't understand Python. Things like generators, decorators, multiprocessing, data classes, functional style programming, to name a few."
"398","Imagine a programmer decided he wants to be a chemist and takes an organic chemistry course or two and gets hired to do lab work and is completely clueless about most things. What would you suggest they do?

Learn and do it fast. Formal learning, informal learning, blogs, books, courses, lectures... everything you can lay your hands on."
"399","Some subjects you should understand at a more than casual level:

* caching: know what a cache replacement policy is and why some are better than others and under what circumstances an LRU eviction policy might not be what you want.

* character sets: Yes the world would be a lot simpler if it were all utf-8 but it is not.

* database systems: you should be familiar with resource management in a database system and with how indexing works in your database and how data is represented on disk and in memory in your database. You should be familiar enough with popular database systems that you can get up to speed quickly.

* networking: most of your data is arriving at your system over the internet and is being passed from component to component inside your system by network connections; know what can go wrong and how and where you can apply sanity checks and error correction codes to data in-flight.

* talking to project managers: If someone is asking you for something impossible, how do you educate them? If someone wants an estimate how do you communicate your error-bars? If someone asks you to do something unethical (e.g. take this batch of behavioral data and figure out which ads are most profitably shown to cancer patients ) how do you push back without losing power?"
"400","I would really call this stuff data engineering.  Data engineers usually mess with stuff like Kafka, Debezium, Postgres, and that sort of thing.  Just making sure data is stored properly and surfaced nicely to the right stakeholders.

It varies widely what kind of programming/engineering/tools skills a data scientist needs.  We use AWS, and some of our machine learning engineers use docker, but I'd only vaguely heard of cron jobs before.  On the other hand, I know a surprising amount of Ruby.  Just learn the basics of whatever people use that you don't know rather than worrying about what skills are generally useful."
"401","Neither. The ability to convince the hiring manager and stakeholders that you can provide value is what is most important. Really, its the same for all jobs."
"402","I think there's a lot of good to be said about getting practical skills and knowing when and why to apply different Data Science techniques to problems that largely overtake a degree in usefulness assuming that you do actually understand the tools your using.

That being said, I can't see how someone can understand a lot of advanced tools data scientist use without having taken the necessary mathematical and statistical foundation courses.  I'm not saying you need a math degree, but I think in order to really be set on the data science tooling you want to have taken multiple levels of calculus, linear algebra, probability and statistics theory, regression analysis, and having a decent amount of coding.  A lot of this can be self taught to fill in gaps, but to self teach all of that *entirely*? It would be pretty hard in my humble opinion."
"403","You can definitely find a job as working in BI or analytics without any real math knowledge. I have a degree in statistics, and frankly outside of a few very large companies or specialized companies, the mathematical knowledge isn't all that high. I don't think I've ever really used much of my math knowledge on the job..."
"404","Definitely, and I'm quite a fan of traditional analytics and BI as career choices.  However they specified ""data scientist"" in the title, and so my response was really geared towards the role as I would imagine most people think of it, that is, leaning towards more advanced statistical modeling/ML implementation."
"405","I disagree with people who say the degree matters because of what you learn during it.

The degree matters because it's a stamp of approval. It tells a prospective employer ""this person was able to get the grades necessary to graduate from a 4 year program, which tells you that there is a minimum degree of capability that they must have achieved AND tells you they are able to do what is necessary to graduate from a work ethic perspective"".

When you don't have a degree, you need to prove all of those things explicitly. This is why a lot of companies require a degree - it's too much effort to vet out a candidate that doesn't have one unless they have extensive work experience.

So my question for you would be - other than dropping out of college, what else do you have in your resume that tells them you will be a hard working employee? That you will meet deadlines?

Skills are a part of it, but showing that you will be a good employee in the more general sense is important."
"406","degree for sure - its the only way to get a foot in the door."
"407","Skill matters. The degree is valuable because of the skills you develop in doing the degree. You can gain useful skills outside of a degree, but it just so happens that degrees are very popular ways of proving you have some of the skills an employer may be looking for."
"408","Drop out at what stage?  For an MS or PhD, you definitely could if you have the skills, it just might not be a research scientist job at a place like Google.  However, it would get significantly harder if you dropped out at the BS/BA level."
"409","Skill/Experience &gt; Degree. A degree mostly helps with getting through HR filters but IMO this mainly happens at bigger companies. If  you have sufficient skill/experience and proven projects then the degree wont matter much.  
  
It all kinda depends on the company you're applying to and the domain its in. You'll most likely need a degree for a hardcore R&amp;D position but if you're applying to a local startup, a degree wont be as important."
"410","Skills.
R,Python are enough I guess."
"411","I already have certificate in this language, I'm also considering getting a data scientist course, just wondering if Dropouts can get a job?
Thanks for the quick response :)"
"412","Certificates are a dime a dozen these days. Obviously shows you have some understanding but won't be worth much on their own. 

Try make a portfolio of projects on github to showcase your ability to write code."
"413","In my experience there seem to be two tribes of hiring managers. Those who value education above all else and those who value practical skill above all else. You will have zero luck with the former but stand a chance with the latter.

I fall into the latter case so can speak to what I look for... I run a data science group in a large asset manager. Would I consider you with a certificate in data analysis - god no. For that matter though, unless your PhD was very specifically applied I probably wouldnt either. What I want is evidence that you can play at this level. For me that means things like a top 5% Kaggle finish, approved pull requests against a library we use or a good story to tell and quantify.

The key point here though, is if this is something you really want to succeed in, you either need the academics, or some tangible proof of skill.

Edit: toned down the wording a touch."
"414","/r/thathappened"
"415","Suit yourself. It might have come across as arrogant (which i've tried to tone down) but it remains true..."
"416","In my opinion don't focus on frameworks, frameworks come and go, any sufficiently big shop might have their own frameworks or some company uses something you've never heard of.

What's important here is learning to learn. If you know the foundational stuff and you can pick up new frameworks, that's what's interesting from an employability perspective. Companies want to know that they can throw you into whatever they've got and you'll swim.

Pick whatever frameworks you do know, and go deeper. Try to figure out what patterns and tricks they use. If you use more than one then compare them, being able to identify strengths and weaknesses is a key skill required in day to day engineering.

Other than that if you do want to learn something new try a new language. Java, JavaScript, Python are always safe bets and used almost everywhere. New languages can give you a whole new perspective which is much more interesting. For example if you compare the idiomatic approaches to a task in Java and Scala.

Critical thinking is key, it's a bit cliche but it's what people are looking for in interviews, rather than a laundry list of tech stacks"
"417","Really depends on the company. The larger companies that interview almost purely based on whiteboarding and leetcode don't care, but I've found that the smaller, less technical companies do care about the tech stacks you've worked with. They don't have the resources to wait and train a junior for 3+ months so they will throw some stack trivia at you during the interview process."
"418","&gt;it's what people are looking for in interviews, rather than a laundry list of tech stacks    
        
The problem is that people are looking for a laundry list of tech stacks to /get/ to the interview stage, at least it seems like that when I look through job listings for junior dev positions or internships and most of them want ""good skills in &lt;40 different frameworks&gt;"".
   
Thanks for your advice!"
"419","I recently saw this LinkedIn post where the person came across a job listing asking for 10 years Kubernetes experience, Kubernetes has been around since 2014 (at least according to Wikipedia). My point is don't be put off by the requirements. It's just spray and pray. Try to be concrete with your experience in your CV (STAR format can be handy) and then you want to be able to nail the interview.

It seems a bit daunting but a honestly there's a lot of luck involved, so all you can do is keep pushing. Eventually it just works out. There's a lot of us like you that have made it so don't be too worried, (just enough to keep you from falling behind)

Good luck!!"
"420","&gt;  asking for 10 years Kubernetes experience, Kubernetes has been around since 2014 

wait till you see those asking for 10 years of deploying react views on Kubernetes ..."
"421","They'll probably want 10 years of swift experience too."
"422","&gt;asking for 10 years Kubernetes experience, Kubernetes has been around since 2014

Well, it's kinda technically possible, it just means they literally want someone from Google's infrastructure team before k8s got open sourced."
"423","Im in the same boat, all interviews cancelled.  Those job postings used to worry me too because I dont have tons of framework skills from my university (and by that I mean a couple were maybe mentioned in one class one semester).  As much as everyone already says it, really just apply anyway...its how I got any interviews in the first place(and made it passed phone screenings to scheduling in person interviews right before this pandemic hit).  It really does seem that the posting is just a hiring rep that doesnt understand the day to day work and bloats the requirements.  I apply, they ask what Ive done and how what Ive learned could make me successful, then I usually get to speak with manager on the team for at least a phone interview."
"424","No, they're *listing* a laundry list of tech stacks, they aren't expecting you to have experience with all of them. Their perfect candidate would, but rarely do companies actually find their perfect candidate."
"425","I have been using Spring framework for about 14 years. Developed several applications that still run.

Not all frameworks come and go."
"426","Okay nobody else has said this.  **DO NOT LEARN PHP**.  I took three PHP classes in college and absolutely nobody was looking for PHP developers when I graduated and started looking for jobs.  If you know Java or C# then you will be able to carry that over to most other OOP languages."
"427","lol too late, I learned PHP long ago. Luckily I know Java well."
"428","The majority of jobs I see in my area look for Java restful services (things like Spring Boot) and either React or Angular.  If you learn those two things I am pretty sure you will have a good pick at jobs.  I have been wasting my time with Django applications for the last few months and every job I have seen online is asking for three years of experience with Django.  I finally got over the learning curve though so I don't want to stop using it."
"429","How long did it take for you to learn Django? I'm really interested in it but I heard about the learning curve."
"430","I would say about 3 months for spending 15 hours a week after work.  I am at a point where I get how all of the files work together and if I got a job I could work my way around the framework.  I am still by no way proficient in it yet however.  Also like I said I can't find a back-end Django developer job that doesn't require several years of experience."
"431","Communication and networking skills. Spend some time working on a moderately large open source project - one that has a defined development process.

Any competent dev can pick up a new stack in a matter of weeks, it's not a big deal. Focus on bigger picture stuff."
"432","Rather than focusing too many language and frameworks.. learn how to write best code, learn how to solve complex business problems.

There are multi purpose language and frameworks. Choose one that has been on the market for a while and will remain for a while. And be perfect on it. Start a pet project, keep adding as many features to that single project. 

Just because you know English, Japanese, Chinese, French, Spanish and Russian.. that doesn't mean you can write a great novel on either of those language. 
Programming works similar way. It's art. Learn how to be good artist!"
"433","Learn Java/C#/JavaScript/Python. These languages are picked to maximize your chances of getting hired. You can get a job working with any language but these are fairly common and in demand. Learn a frontend framework like React/Angular/Vue, check the state of JavaScript report to see what is going in and out of favor. React is a solid choice and so Vue. Build some projects using whatever language is relevant to you. Build some webapps, they can do whatever but even better if it's for a problem you or someone close to you has.

Getting a job is going to be tough this year. Depends on how fast the economy recovers."
"434","It heavily depends on region and target employers. So a lot of west coast FANG companies use Python. A lot of low and medium COL companies use Microsoft stacks. I do mostly Microsoft and medium COL and the skills we usually look for are.

Web API, Angular, Azure, C#, and Agile.

The skills I've seen as having a lack of food candidates are due to cost of entry in large part...

Cloud and DevOps.

I would recommend getting a cloud cert and OOP for most companies. For FANG leetcode and Python are a good call."
"435","&gt; What else would you recommend?

To the specific end of ""land[ing] a job"", whatever gets the most hits on jobs boards. That's going to vary depending on where specifically you're looking for jobs. Some areas have 90% of the shops using C#, some have 0%. Professionals frequently caution against [resume driven development](http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/10/resume-driven-development.html) but it's a fine strategy for getting ""a job, any job"".

That sort of maximizing tapers off pretty quickly once you get a few years north of the entry level. Employable engineers are good general purpose problem solvers who can navigate common software design patterns, not people who brute forced an understanding of the latest-and-greatest stack."
"436","&gt;but it's a fine strategy for getting ""a job, any job"".   
     
That's definitely what I want right now. I just want to get my foot into SWE professionally.   
    
&gt;who can navigate common software design patterns       
    
Is this even something that I can learn on my own? When I learned about them in my courses, it seemed very theoretical and I don't really know what to do with my knowledge about design patterns."
"437","&gt; Is this even something that I can learn on my own?

Kinda sorta? [Code Complete](https://smile.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670) is a fantastic resource for this stuff. Understanding which patterns to apply and when to apply them takes time and wisdom. It's a puzzle that is heavily influenced by the business requirements of the thing you're building. 

With respect to architectural choices, you're also subject to the team(s) that will be interacting with or depending on your service."
"438","Emotional intelligence"
"439","Not easy to learn alone at home during a pandemic with everything on lockdown :D"
"440","Wait really? How come there are still recruiters reaching out to me"

"445","Look at the job listings in your area, and look for repeated mentions of any languages or frameworks. Pay attention to the types of companies that use certain technologies. For example, here in the U.S., Spring or any Java would be very rare outside of financial industry. Drupal is used by mostly government and large corporate organizations. Laravel, RoR, Django are more common with typical startups. Think about what kind of company you want to work for.

I think that we'll see more stability through a likely recession with more established companies, so even though some of what they use is considered more dated or less hip and fun, there will be more opportunities for people who know somewhat older frameworks and languages. Ruby on Rails and Laravel will always be in demand."
"446","&gt;For example, here in the U.S., Spring or any Java would be very rare outside of financial industry     
     
Interesting. I actually started to learn Spring because that's what I see in many job listings in my area and the financial industry is very strong here."
"447","Java is not rare."
"448","Sounds like you're on the right track!"
"449","I did my PhD using matlab. So.... No."

"457","I agree, coding quality is generally not encouraged as much as papers, but it can depend on your field as well.  If people are doing ML in an applied field and cross discipline (e.g. engineering, physics, biology), and their works winds up as tools/platforms for others, then they usually have decent programming skills."
"458","If it does it's a side effect. A PhD is about doing research."
"459","I'm working with a guy who has a PhD. He is a terrible programmer."
"460","I knew a few who mostly worked with excel during their PhD"
"461","I'm working with a few guys without PhDs. The quality of their code is universally atrocious.

I don't think the ability to write good code correlates with having or not having a phd."
"462","I don't know, I would probably still be writing shitty code if I hadn't worked with a real project where quality code was required. Obviously it's not a rule, but I talked to a friend about it and he said all PhD persons he had worked with wrote shitty code."
"463","Imho, it's more about the willingness to put the effort to write quality code and having the right environment to learn good practices. This is not something that people are born with, you have to put the effort into it.

In a way, this talks more about the company rather than the people. Your colleagues don't write code in a vacuum, they write it in collaboration with other people. If you don't push for quality, the results will always be very underwhelming.

p.s. For example, at the company where I work now, there are veteran coders who write universally incomprehensible and undocumented code... even in high-level languages. The new coders they hire are also equally awful. The catch is that no one at the company ever bothered to establish and enforce good coding practices, so you get what you get."
"464","A PhD will definitely improve your coding skills. Software engineering skills? Probably not, unless you work with people who have good practice.

There are quite a few people in my lab that came to get their master's or PhD's after being a SE in industry for a while. They always scream when they see my code... I'm not a PhD but...yeah..... :("
"465","I'll probably get downvoted into oblivion for this, but as a software engineer working the past six years in ML, optimization, and simulation, I work with quite a few PhD contributors. Saying something looks like ""PhD code"" is not a compliment. It's often hacked together just enough to illustrate a concept. There are exceptions, but PhD folks are people, too, and not all of them want to be craftsmen (or craftswomen) when it comes to code. In fact, very few of them do.

So, no, in my limited experience, people with PhDs have not had their software engineering skills improved by their university training. But they probably did learn to code or code better."
"466","&gt;software engineer working the past six years in ML, optimization, and simulation

I'm an undergrad and I'm extremely interested in these topics. Do you mind if I pm you a few questions?"
"467","Please do."
"468","Yes, a lot. My Prof came from industry, before her tenure, she worked at Google. Thus, she was pretty experienced and had a different view than someone who never went outside universities. However, she approached most problems very differently from how I used to. Prior to the PhD I had quite a bit of work experience but I was caught in what I would now consider a trap of framework upon framework and ""enterprise best practices"". 

During my time we always built fully functional applications to showcase our resarch and we usually did so from scratch so that we would know about all possible sideeffects. I know that many things we did in terms of software engineering on top of the actual research were probably a very backwards and not best practice (the worst example probably being homegrown webservers from socket code in C and XML/JSON response over HTTP building the strings by hand -- not everything was that bad, of course).

In the long run, I think, this helped me tremendously. Back in industry, it was time to adapt again and, of course, it takes a bit to get used to everything. However, knowing both sides and especially knowing a lot more about fundamentals feels very valueable to me."
"469","You don't enter a PhD program to be a better engineer, you enter to be a better scientist.

Coding is something you get undergrads to do for you =p"
"470","When I completed my PhD (and postdoc), I was convinced I learned a lot about software engineering, and others told me that I wrote nice code. Then I started a role in industry and learned that I knew practically nothing of modern software engineering practices, good testing, design patterns, continuous delivery, agile collaboration, planning / estimating, and all the rest that you will have to deal with as a software engineer (what's a product manager again?).

Long story short - whatever coding you do during your PhD has probably very little in common with ""proper"" software engineering practices, but you'll be able to pick it up quickly. Software engineering involves a lot of stuff, and solving an actual problem with code is just a very small part of it. If you can get that through an internship will depend on the internship - most companies won't let you get close to production code."
"471","A PhD is of course a doctor of philosophy which values much more than the tools of the field. Programming is a tool that researchers can use should they choose, but isn't strictly necessary. I wouldn't expect all construction workers to be experts with a hammer; many only use the hammer once every few weeks."
"472","I coded quite a lot during my PhD which in turn increased my overall SW engineering skills too. Though, im obviously not as skilled now as I would have been when pursuing an industry position right after my masters."
"473","Doing PhD. My fellow research scholars consider me programming wizard. All I do is Google the errors."
"474","So arguing a bit against the mainstream, most PhD programs have fairly limited access to computational resources and so you learn to be much more judicious with experiments and testing when you don't have 1000 EC2 instances you can just fire up. You also usually get quite good at making algorithms CPU/memory efficient so you can iterate quicker. You won't have the same mentorship and rigorously enforced software engineering culture you would at a company, but you can usually find a few allies. You are also (normally) completely free to work with and contribute to open-source which often isn't the case outside of academia and can massively improve your skills. Numpy, Pandas, Spark, Tensorflow, Dask all have excellent coding practices and ecosystems that rival many tech companies."
"475","Yes.

But in more of how to plan and execute projects. I already knew Python  even before my phd.

You can always ask  or read if there's something you don't know, leading your own project is the next level shit."

"489","Do you know of a good source to learn more about the energy use of cryptomining?"
"490","Not off the top of my head, but look around and you'll find some.  On a small scale it's not that bad, but with mining now being as wide spread as it is, and the process being inefficient (by necessity), it ends up wasting a lot of energy.  
  
On it's own this isn't a death sentence to cryptomining, it's only as dirty as what creates the electricity for it, the issues would be drastically reduced if it were powered entirely off of green energy for example (hey, idea:  make crypto miners powered off of wind, solar, nuclear, and geothermal energy to offset their creation costs), but excess energy demand typically takes the dirtiest/cheapest energy sources because it's the easiest to bring to market."
"491","Proof of stake algorithms were supposed to reduce the power waste problems from proof of work algorithms in mining (that give a preference to higher hashrate). But I have fell out of the crypto scene so I don't know if many of the major players have carried through with that conversion."

And it only goes wrong when they're not maintained properly.  So create software that can't be bypassed that forces regulatory compliance."

"504","Hi OP Im no expert I am a lost twenty year old in a CS major with the same hopes as you. My current plan is to do some half/half major between CS and chemistry and then go into a PhD program with my super slick CS skills and.... somehow help solve problems in polymers or batteries? Chemistry majors are well positioned to solve these problems imo. Not sure if my plan will work will update in thirty years."
"505","Probably the best environmental impact you could have would be to make a commonly used program slightly more efficient and save that power from ever being used."
"506","This is a good one, it's along the lines of what I was saying.  If you can do things that result in less power drain, in theory that should reduce environmental impact.  Though in practice, it might just lead to people using more power to take advantage of the excess that's available."

"509","[removed]"
"510","I like associating skills with the projects or work experience subsections to which they pertain. That gives the reader a timeframe in which they were used or learned, as well as the context."
"511","Everyone here bad mouths them, but I'm a hiring manager and I like them. I don't think if you give yourself an arbitrary 9/10 or 10/10 that you're ACTUALLY that skilled at it, but I do use it as a means to easily identify which languages or skills you believe you're better at and which you know but aren't as proficient.  If someone has 3 programming languages listed with different ratings I don't even need to ask them which language I should ask them questions for. 

What I see about these which does annoy me when using these: 

* overly detailed scales (no ticks, but one looks to be 7/10, one 7.5/10, one 8/10 - far too granular)
* Everything is listed as highly rated
* Way too many things listed. Don't rate yourself on 30 different skills. Not even 10
* Soft skills rated. Not useful information really as they tend to be over stated. The one you link - 10/10 hardworking? Like really are you in the literal top 1% of performers when it comes to hardworking-ness? Or do you work really hard like everyone else? I roll my eyes when anyone gives themselves 10/10 on any soft skills. 
* Unsubstantiated claims - and this one drives me NUTS. Give yourself a 4/5 on Java? Fine, but I have to SEE in the rest of your resume where you have used Java and get a good idea from actual words how experienced you are from the rest of your resume. 

So if you really want to use them, do. I don't know of any hiring managers who would throw out your resume for having bars graphs. 

The alternate is to just leave it off, and let the text of your resume to speak for itself. Upon reading I should be able to see in your case for example that you used Java at a job 6 months ago but not at your most recent job. You can always clarify in the actual interview when it matters. Not every interviewer is going to ask, but I usually ask candidates to rate themselves informally or ask what their preferred language is, or what their experience is with a particular language before jumping in with more questions."
"512","I find it too hard to evaluate my level at a language. I mostly do C++ and the more I program, the more I learn how much I don't know about that language. I've met a lot of other students who think they are good at C++ but have no idea what l and r values are, what metaprogramming is or what Boost is. I feel like someone with 10 years of experience in C++ would rate himself a 5/10 when someone with 1 year of experience would rate himself a 7/10."
"513","Yup, and a person I was interviewing with was blown away when someone I was interviewing with 10 years of experience exclusively in Java rated himself as 7/10. The person interviewing with me questioned him, and he replied that well he certainly could know more about java compilers. 

Really, just about everyone rates them around 7/10. I've had interns rate themselves 7/10. It's kind of like the pain scale when you're at the hospital. When you walk in and say your pain is at a 7/10 that's not very important, but if later you're saying it's 10/10 worst pain you've ever had clearly you've gotten worse - the actual score is meaningless - it's the delta which matters. Java listed at 7/10. PHP listed at 5/10? Great I've learned something - not that you're 7/10 on Java but you know Java quite a bit better than PHP."
"514","I'm going to be 40 next month myself. What basically happend to you, and sorry to be blunt, is that you have become complacent over the last X years and didn't really learn anything new. Generally over time people specialise in a certain direction.

What is happening now is that you're starting to get 'stuck' in basically the bottom layer of the software industry: small web agency stuff. It pays like shit, you do the exact same thing time and time again, and because it's simply stuff people generally don't care about doing things 'right' (unit testing, CI/CD, etc.). They just care about cost. 

The problem is that it's easy to get 'stuck' in that layer because companies look mostly at what you've done before. A lot of Bootcamp people get 'stuck' there. And all those Bootcamp grads can do the same thing you're doing, probably for less money. That part of the industry is just a race to the bottom.

So this is an area you will need to get out of, and frankly it's going to be hard and take a LOT of effort on your part. You should first and foremost focus on the type of jobs you want. Is that more enterprise oriented C# for example? Great: tons of work there for experienced developers. But not even understanding unit testing is an instant disqualifier for jobs like that. It's not 2002 anymore, unit tests are the norm. 

So yes, I think for now it's much better to go back to a more junior level because for more 'high end' jobs, where you can actually have a 'career', that's the level you're at now."
"515","&gt; But not even understanding unit testing is an instant disqualifier for jobs like that. It's not 2002 anymore, unit tests are the norm. 

That's why I'm going to join Coursera to understand unit testing.
It's pretty odd though that they don't train you to cover the missing links. I figure if I have least 50% or 60% of their requirements for most jobs they can cover the rest for me in the on-board process of the job."
"516","Why on earth would a company go and train you on something you should know? For a company you not knowing basics like that is a huge red flag: it just shows that hiring you has the risk that they are going to need to spend a LOT of time on you. You don't 'learn' unit testing with a simple course; you just start with the basics. 

And who's going to have to spend that time? Their senior developers. Who really don't want to do that. And are expensive.

Learning testing is not about just knowing how to create a test; it's about how to *design* testable software. This is something that takes years to develop/grow. That course is just a start, it does not take you to the level expected from a senior developer.

I'm sorry but that's just awfully naive, especially for someone who's been in the industry for 10 years."
"517","&gt; Why on earth would a company go and train you on something you should know?

Tell me where I should I pick up this knowledge, then. Do you mean building personal projects to get this knowledge?

&gt; Learning testing is not about just knowing how to create a test; it's about how to design testable software.

I've seen many companies these days expect unit testing from junior developers too. That's why I brought up training. If it's something that companies need a junior dev to do as well, it should be learned very soon."
"518","&gt; Tell me where I should I pick up this knowledge, then. Do you mean building personal projects to get this knowledge?

Projects, courses, yes.

&gt; I've seen many companies these days expect unit testing from junior developers too. That's why I brought up training. If it's something that companies need a junior dev to do as well, it should be learned very soon.

Sure, but that's generally something you start with in an internship and then develop over time. Not something you want to have to teach a senior developer."
"519","In that case then I *do* have to take a course to learn the basics, and I just want to focus on junior level jobs anyways since I am not fit for senior jobs and I do not have internship experience. Recruiters contact me about senior jobs but I tend to ignore those."
"520","Sounds like a plan :) Best of luck!"
"521","Mongo, C#, react, Node...your skill set is not dated as long as you have some depth in the areas you list.  Perhaps interviewing just isn't a strong suit of yours.  Don't worry, its not a strong suit for a lot of people.  I'm of the  mind set that the resume serves one purpose. It gets you that initial phone call, if its consistently doing that then you're set in that regard.

Interviewing for a programming job and ""doing"" a programming job are completely different beasts. It sucks, but its true. As others have mentioned you might gain a lot from doing code challenges on leetcode or codewars.  It helps to develop those skills for quick problem deconstruction like you'll get in white board questions.

Phone interviews are yet another different type of interview. Without the face to face non-verbals and visual aids like a white board you have to sell yourself with your voice, your enthusiasm and your ability to speak well about what you've done.  Its a sale pitch. If they ask what've you been doing for the last few years (and they will), if you go in with a 4 second thought that blandly describes what you did, its over.  

Which sounds better?

&gt;I was a remote engineer doing freelance work. I worked on several small projects for a some non profits with Ruby and MySql. I also built a game.

or

&gt;The last few years have been amazing! I've been helping a lot of nonprofits build a presence in their communities and retool their websites to do X, Y, Z.  Most of my clients had preexisting sites that we extended using Ruby with MySql back-end and most recently I had the opportunity to launch an indie game where the player is tasked with A, B , C and we built that thing from the ground up with C#, so far its sold ### copies.  I've been lucky enough to get a wide breadth of knowledge over the last 4 years but now I'm looking to dive deeper in my next role and that's how I found your company.

Extreme examples to prove a point but hopefully you get my drift. Both of those say the exact same depth of content about the most recent position on your resume...but I'd only bring in the second guy for an in person to get to know him better."
"522","I like the second one more.  The thing is with me, I don't feel **genuine** about writing up my accomplishments that way."
"523","Sounds like maybe you have a bit of a confidence issue? I know I did for the longest time and had the same types of thoughts.  My biggest  hurdle to get over was, ""well yeah, the team built the software that helped 500k customers, but I only really wrote the the code that fetched data and handed it back to a web request.""   So i described it similarly, ""i worked with C# fetching data from SQL server for a REST request"". 

Its a game you play with interviewers.  They know you didn't do everything yourself, they know the day to day is boring and less glamorous than the sizzle you add.  They know the stack overflow searches are many.  But the confidence you exude in how you talk about yourself and your work is equally important (if not more important) than what you say.  In the above examples, the second one has the added benefit of showing pride and commitment in your work.  That's a big plus to any potential employer and isn't something you can directly ask about (its an intangible quality).  Its a big risk hiring someone.  Testing for (and subsequently teaching) technical skills is relatively easy but you have to make them want to work with you and show that you are up the challenge if they take the risk on you.

Think of an interview as a first date (because it is).  If you are the world's most accomplished skydiver billionaire playboy but you can't carry on a conversation or look at your feet the whole time, she isn't going to call you back for a second date."
"524","&gt; I don't feel genuine 

Fuck-all about feeling genuine dude, you're the one living in poverty! You've got good stuff on your resume, i'd spin all that to senior/architect all star! Don't give a Damn about feeling genuine, this is LIFE, no one gives a shit about your integrity or honesty, seriously.

Dude I can not stress this enough; EVERYONE spins their experience and sells themselves. There is no shame in it, it's a game, and you have to play it! What you have to do pass a technical interview. So pick a stack and study interview questions for it; learn what the tricky language questions are etc.

I also stress, you have what others on this sub wish they had; documented experience. The only thing between you and 6 figure salary is some resume juice and study. Dude, $100k after taxes is a $3000 pay check every two damn weeks. Just think about that for a second. three. thousand. dollars. Every fucking pay check.  Think about what you can do for yourself and your family.

For god's sake man, go get it!"
"525","&gt; Mongo, C#, react, Node...your skill set is not dated as long as you have some depth in the areas you list.

That's the problem: he has no depth. Anyone can do a pet project with Mongo and put it on his resume, but that does not make you an attractive candidate. At a 'senior' level you're expected to know the ins and outs of whatever C# framework is current now, not know how to go through a simple Hello World."
"526","Yep I think you almost got it. I do know my way around some MVC frameworks but mostly CodeIgniter and that doesn't get much use these days (compare it to another PHP framework like Laravel). The SaaS product is the most complex thing I've worked on. And the job before that, I've taken a project from flowcharts to a backend MVP.

But also, lack of depth could also be related to not being able to work on anything on a bigger scale and getting a bird's eye view of the whole situation. Most of my day just consists of submitting commits, updating tickets and PR's. Not much depth beyond that. Programming at work feels a lot like programming in my hobby projects, with the exception of having to report updates to my manager at work.

So if I should apply to junior jobs, then should I take some of my older jobs off my resume? I could fill in the empty space with some projects I have worked on."
"527","&gt; Interviewing for a programming job and ""doing"" a programming job are completely different beasts

It's time to combine them into one singular isomorphic beast, then. That way, what's good for the goose is also good for the gander. Then it becomes a piece of cake, second nature."
"528",""" I get some phone interviews for some major companies but can't pass them. ""  


Identify why you are failing your interviews and work on that. What are you having trouble with during the interviews?"
"529","I'm trying my damndest to. But any ""doubt"" actions from interviewers on the phone are hard for me to read, or I cannot identify my own weak points on the phone. Like I said my communication skills have hardly failed me at work which makes this confusing. 

If introspection is what I need, what things can I do to improve my ability to introspect?"
"530","Are you getting technical questions? Make sure you go into the interview feeling confident. If you have trouble with projecting confidence then take a few shots of alcohol for some liquid courage (it works). If you are failing on technical questions you should be able to tell since you will know yourself whether you know the material or not."
"531","I usually get technical questions after the recruiter screening round. It's right after the technical parts that I usually get a rejection.

I know I will fail hard on system design and unit testing which is why I am considering taking Coursera classes for them.

As far as confidence and personality goes, every company's culture is that company's ""personality"". So it's just a matter of finding the right companies that are a personality fit for me. If I cannot change the way I interview to suit certain companies, the viable alternative is to change the types of companies that would find me the most pleasant. Trying to do that the start of this year."
"532","Do leetcode maybe? Most places are dont care which language you use. Out of curiosity what tech stacks are you familiar with and what do you work on? May help me figure out whats going wrong here."
"533","I know mostly the LAMP stack, with both MongoDB and MySQL, plus a bit of Ruby and JavaScript work on the side."
"534","If you are failing after the technical interview you should worry less about being pleasant and more about becoming more technically competent. A person should be pleasant by default when being interviewed for a position. Are the positions you are applying for looking for a LAMP developer? Tailor your resume for each position. If you want a specific job and dont have the skills then train on them. One of the things about this field is you have to constantly retool yourself with new technologies as time goes on."
"535","I want to get out of LAMP stack, and also get into a more modernized development pipeline that uses Continuous Integration and automated testing, plus deploying to cloud services. 

I am considering junior level positions because many people say I have a ""junior"" vibe to my interviews and also because companies allocate more training time to the juniors.

My own experience of deploying websites is mainly limited to uploading files to third party shared hosting (such as BlueHost) and mainly manage them through SSH or a GUI front end like Plesk or cPanel. I don't see anyone talking about those tools anymore."

"538","Out of the FAANG companies, Google and Facebook ignore my resumes. Haven't heard yet from Amazon (I applied more recently).

I know about Leetcode and how it helps out at bigger companies but all the  Leetcode grinding in the world won't do me any good if my resume is the show stopper. I posted my anonymized resume in the OP. What is your resume advice for bigger companies?"
"539","&gt; Out of the FAANG companies, Google and Facebook ignore my resumes. Haven't heard yet from Amazon (I applied more recently).

Frankly with your resume you're just aiming too high."
"540","You can post your resume on rooftopslushie.com where FAANG/big-N engineers offer you detailed feedback on your resume (resume review, career advice, etc) for $5-30 per engineer(you set the price but again, be reasonable). You can ask 5-6 questions (or even more, I dont know).

Ive heard from some people that they even offer referrals but my reviewers said that they didnt have any openings at my level."
"541","I have my resume right in the OP lol, review it here."
"542","What positions are you applying to? Your skills need to match the position you are applying for."
"543","No, if you want advice from FAANG engineers do that. Im not a web developer plus I havent used most of the technologies listed in your resume."
"544","&gt;Maybe I should go back to a junior level job as a temporary stepping  stone but do it at a much better company that actually builds up their  developers well?

It's usually very difficult to get a junior role after you have more than a few years of industry experience."
"545","This is the fate of older devs and well probably be seeing more of this in the years to come. The industry isnt nice to those of us closer to 40 than 20. Even more harsh on those over 40. I dont think anyone has figured it out. There is some myth that older people cant learn, and 18-25 year olds fully believe it. Additionally, non tech business units (and I mean those marketing MBA *units*) dont see devs as anything more than autistic drones. Theyd rather just use us as disposable employees to build them glorious digital whatever that they get the credit for. As such, being older with commitments and opinions doesnt fit with their stereotype. 

Has anyone ever worked for a non tech company that has strong executives that was promoted out of the IT or engineering paths? Usually even CTOs either come from other departments or its a title granted on top of CFO or COO. Were second class citizens. 

Anyways, sorry I dont have anything useful to contribute. My experience is more dated and as much as I try to develop myself through a graduate degree outside of work, the projects at work arent there and they dont seem too interested in my future."
"546","&gt; This is the fate of older devs and well probably be seeing more of this in the years to come.

Nonsense. I'm almost 40. What happened here was that he didn't gain 12+ years of experience, he gained 1 years of experience and then kept doing the same thing for 10 years. This has nothing to do with age."
"547","Any articles you can recommend that talk about probable solutions to the problem of 1x10 years of experience?"
"548","Well it's simple: work hard during your job or on your own time fulling the gaps. But while it's simple, it's not easy. It just takes a lot of time. And there are no simple courses to give experience you'd normally gain on the job. 

You should start by trying to focus on a certain stack when it comes to jobs, so you don't have your experience / skills all over the place. I mean I've done PHP and ColdFusion in the past for example, but I don't even have those on my resume because they're not relevant to the jobs I aim for."
"549","I don't want to do PHP anymore, but it is tricky to try and completely remove it from my resume (if I were to remove older jobs) because I used it as recently as my *most recent* non-freelance job. I only became PHP-free when I started freelancing. In some freelance gigs I have picked up most recent experience with Ruby on Rails. Outside of its rather odd syntax the framework does make a lot of familiar sense to me. MV* has in general been something I can grok fairly well whether I want to use Rails, React or Vue."
"550","Im interested in this as well. Personal projects lose steam and generally arent as helpful to get one past HR filters as they are sold to be."
"551","&gt; The industry isnt nice to those of us closer to 40 than 20. Even more harsh on those over 40. 

I still don't buy though. If it were true then this career would actively discourage retiring at the normal age of 60-65. And CS would be much less popular then, because how many would willingly take up a career with an early death?"
"552","People just repeating the myths they heard. Its not about age, its about people who don't continue to learn and adapt which is often correlated with age."
"553","Its not about being old. Its about refusing to learn new and relevant skills that are in demand."
"554","Companies like older devs, what they don't like is older devs that have the skills of a junior dev.

When you have 10+ years of experience as a developer, most companies expect at least a senior engineer level of aptitude. If you're lacking that, then many companies will judge you as incompetent and less capable of learning/improving than average, and will likely pass on you."
"555","Your resume seemed fine. And being in your 30s and 40s is fine as a SWE. Heres what matters:

 Skillset  Java and Python are really good to have. 

 LinkedIn profile  Try setting your location on LI to somewhere in the Bay Area or other tech hub and see how many recruiters hit you up. Make sure your LI settings indicate youre actively looking for a job. Make sure you put your complete work history and skillset on LI for SEO. 

 Once you get the phone interview, you will be expected to interview as a Senior. For this, prepare using Leetcode and system design tutorials like Grokking the System Design Interview. Cracking the Code Interview is also good. 

You can do it. Just a matter of time, studying, and persistence."
"556","Does system design require an understanding of the deployment pipeline around it?

I don't see anyone talking about those tools anymore."
"557","Its like  how would you design a URL shortening service (the backend)? Think of bit.ly.

- Would you have a load balancer, and how would it generally work?
- Would you have multiple datacenters, and if so where?
- What kind of database(s) would you use?
- What level of reliability do you need? And what are you targeting?
- Whats your actual URL shortening algorithm?
- How many URLs would your system be able to support (roughly) and would you scale the design to handle more URLs or more queries per second?

All these questions. Thats system design. Basically if you are to design a backend system from ground up."
"558","Instead of playing around on reddit you should be focusing on developing skills that are in demand. You have said multiple times through this thread that you know about modern technologies but then complain that employers should train you in these skills...

"565","If you already have an interview, the people interviewing you probably already have that resume, it's too late.

I'd say at this point your options are either to own up to it, which you can do gracefully. Or cram it, which honestly might work.

Overall, I'd say don't embellish on your resume. If you have a little experience with a skill, but not much, just put something like

&gt; foo (some experience)

As an interviewer I'd take that to mean ""this person has worked with it, probably can get something done, but is not an expert, would love to dig in a bit more and see what they know.""

If you are not comfortable with the above, you probably shouldn't even have it on the resume at all."
"566","Yes"
"567","What skill did you embellish, and what role are you being considered for? If youre being interviewed by individual teams that usually means youre being considered for something more specialized like an ML team or mobile development specialist.

Will this lead to losing an offer? Possible, because it definitely sounds like youre being targeted for specialist roles. They might also just decide to add you to the general software engineer pool if the teams youre talking to all take a pass, but thats not a guarantee either."

Have you built stuff outside of class that uses these concepts? Depending what you've been exposed to &amp; used, your understanding of ""fundamental CS concepts"" might be different from somebody accustomed to another language.  

Build something in the language you're most comfortable in that forces you to apply the concepts you want to learn. Then build it (or something similar) again in a different language where the concepts are implemented differently, or don't even exist. Coming at things from different angles and in multiple contexts can help you recognize patterns &amp; solidify  understanding. 

If you build the same project with C++, Java, Swift, and Python, you would have to use abstract classes, inheritance, and interfaces/protocols in completely different ways, and you'll likely understand them better in the end."
"575","Can't say I agree with the first paragraph. Practicing ""pitching"" the concepts help, but it's limited. Especially pitching to people who don't understand. The reason is, the issue that OP says sounds more like he doesn't understand the concepts.

The remaining parts are all great points. I would suggest the same thing from a different angel: Find some real world scenario, choose a language, and build the same thing in different ways, for example, abstract class vs interfaces. It wouldn't take long for you to notice the difference and find a reason about why choose this over that? Keep doing this is likely the most efficient way to really grasp the core, IMO."
"576","I'm... not sure how you passed a data structures and/or algorithms course, but this is still certainly fixable.

 \- an ArrayList, more or less; something backed by an array that resizes itself if you put too much in there  
 \- a first-in, first-out queue

 \- binary tree  
 \- heap  
 \- undirected graph, represented as objects/pointers

 \- AVL balanced binary tree, using the binary tree from above  
 \- linear probing hashtable, using one of those resizeable arrays from above  


I'd pick a language, probably Java, C#, or Python.  And I'd implement each of those without using anything other than language primitives.  (Only use int, string, arrays, loops, functions, and if statements.)  I'd write unit tests to make sure they worked.   And then move to the next one.  Possibly go through the list of things twice, and make sure it gets ridiculously faster the second time.  


Until you've got at least half of that list, you're going to have a hell of a time with interviews, so just sack a weekend or two and do it.  


Separately, for ""I don't know object oriented stuff"", you're just going to need to write more object oriented code."
"577","If OP is anything like me, the data structures course was taught by a grad student just doing it to check off a box, and gave everyone A's and B's even though we understood very little.

We didn't have a specific Algorithms course, some was covered in datastructures, but I picked most of that up on my own."
"578","My algorithms course was taught by a professor who was like 70 years old and tenured. He was a math guy, really, but was part of the CS dept to teach these types of courses. I had to take a few of his courses over the years, and each class was the same. Everyone got an A or B no matter what. Often times, he would not even teach or quiz you on the actual subject, but some other unrelated subject he went on a tangent about. It was really frustrating, but as a student who switched majors late and worked a factory job, it was somewhat nice having one less class to study for. I pay for it now by not knowing shit and just work IT instead."
"579","I had a professor exactly like this at Florida State lmao. Idk how I passed some of his classes"
"580","I think I know exactly who you mean, and he still is teaching there"
"581","Oh yeah. I just graduated 5 months ago and I had him as one of my last classes lol. Good God he was painful as a lecturer but man is he intelligent if you talk to him one on one. He has all kinds of knowledge. Hes like the perfect grandpa for me lol."
"582","At least you guy got A or B for your resume. I had teachers who were too strict that even if your code is one second slower than his solution, you'll get C or below. My GPA really sucks that I can't even apply for graduate school."
"583","I pride myself in fast solutions but there was one assignment that my TA graded (it was in class grading) and he took points off because it took minutes to run (literal minutes). We tried to find out why it was so slow but even when we analyzed the code, neither of us could come up with an answer of why it was so slow. Still havent figured it out to this day lol"
"584","Is that normal in the states? In Canada, we learn Linked Lists to Heaps in first year.."
"585","It varies widely. The best schools bake strong DSA fundamentals into all their classes. Good schools can have a weak DSA class but bake the knowledge into other classes."
"586","I've seen up through linked lists in the intro course, and a full data structures course in the second semester, that should cover most of it.  Some universities have a separate junior or senior-level course on algorithms that goes much farther, but the data structures course is the most transferrable to industry (and to industry interviews, for various companies)."
"587","I'm from Canada and we learnt it in second year. York U student here"
"588","I'm at Queens. We have 2 python courses each sem, the 2nd sem one we do some data structures, searching &amp; sorting, complexity, recursion, that stuff. Though most is also taught in second year (DFS/BFS, Dijkstra, Prim/Kruskal, Hashing, Red Black Tree, etc)."
"589","&gt; Is that normal in the states?

No"
"590","It probably varies a lot by school. In the spring of my freshman year, we implemented a singly linked list, hash set, and a priority queue with a heap, along with a few other things"
"591","Can confirm, in Alberta and we learn all sorts of data structures (not as rigorously as an algo course) in winter semester of first year."
"592","Yup yup same"
"593","That sounds like great practice. But for the record, I've never been asked about any of those data structures in interviews."
"594","Youve never been asked a Linked List, Queue, Stack, heap or binary tree question in an interview? Even non tech companies asked me LL or stack questions."
"595","I have been doing development for about 20 years and I have never had to implement from scratch any data structure. I vaguely remember them from sophomore year at school.

Both Java and .NET have implementations of most major data-structures if one needs to use them. And I am 100% sure however that is done I couldn't do it better."
"596","Knowing how the data structures work at a fundamental level makes it very easy to explain characteristics of them abstractly. You obviously will probably never have to do it in practice, but the meta knowledge is useful."
"597","Yeah I get that, but think about how ridiculous that is. Over the last 20 years how many frameworks, custom libraries, sets of controls, ORMs, patterns and other things I had to learn on a year to year basis and somehow still do 40+ hours of work and have some kind of family / personal life ... but I should be expected to remember something that I learned in 1997 for 3-4 weeks and NEVER used again. 

I mean I know what a link list is, I know how to use it but hell if I remember how to implement it. But I can 100% Google the concept in in a day or two do it. But that's not what they want in an interview, they want you to spit these things out cause ... I don't even know why."
"598","Its mostly eliminating false positive candidates. I imagine there are probably far less people who can whiteboard a LC hard graph problem who are poor coders than there are very shitty programmers who excel at solving them.

Of course they also probably plan to discriminate a bit against a older workforce for cultural and financial reasons."
"599","I think the idea that solving complex programming skills isn't practically useful is bogus, no matter how much it is cargo culted on this subreddit.

That said, I really like your comment. In some domains, you will never need a trie, but I know some interviewers ask questions which can't be solved optimally without them. Someone who can tell you how a trie works probably has some other excellent engineering or academic work. It obviously doesn't prove they are a great engineer, but this reasoning that there are more great engineers that know tries than not is probably true.

As far as ageism goes, I don't think the age thing is intentional, but I do agree that these sorts of questions bias towards 'recency of college degree', which indirectly hurts older candidates. We need to be careful to also ask questions which capture engineers with the invaluable talent and experience and understand the inherent biases in our interviewing techniques."
"600","You're missing the people who are good at what they do and can't whiteboard an ""LC hard"" graph problem without spending some time learning it because it has nothing to do with their expertise."
"601","He's talking about false positives, and you're talking about missing out on quality candidates. Both are bad and you have to give someone a chance eventually, but false positives are very expensive to companies and I think the priority in hiring has shifted toward avoiding them. 

In my interview process for my job there was no whiteboarding or anything like that. There was a screening to weed out ""poor culture fits"" and unqualified candidates early, then a brief technical interview, (a *conversation* about things I've worked on previously, what I knew about the new company's stack, and any questions I had for them) then there was a take-home challenge to see if I could make something simple (8hrs of work) and functional in the company's stack, an interview about that to see if I really made the solution myself and more importantly if I had decent technical communication skills, then a personality test to see my ""working style"", and finally after all that was graded, I met with a higher up to get further vetted and discuss anything else

I think whiteboarding is a bullshit way to assess technical competency for a developer, when there are significantly better ways, like what my company did. If you want to make sure someone can do something, ask them to do that thing. I'm sure white boarding will fall out of favor with any not google-esque companies that are still using it for some reason. I also think this sub is overly focused on whiteboarding, leetcode shit, and overly academic things"
"602","Im not because the companies dont care about losing quality candidates when their pipeline of quality candidates vastly exceeds how many they realistically hire.

If that ever changes they will look for alternatives."
"603","Because people relying on abstractions and frameworks without understanding what's happening under the hood is an actual problem."
"604","Probably the realest issue emerging over the next 10 years for Dev."
"605","if you know what a linked list is, but not how to implement it, maybe you don't know what a LL is.

also i know not everybody is into blockchain, but it's basically a giant linked list with a little crypto. git is also basically just a LL.

someone else isn't always going to write the code first. us senior people are supposed to be the ones inventing frameworks and platforms, not waiting for someone else to do it. we can't lose sight of the building blocks."
"606","That's the cost of being a professional though, right? Doctors are expected to operate tools *and* interpret the results. They need to understand biological processes in the human body at low and high levels, as well as how to apply medicine to alter them. I don't think I agree that it's ridiculous to expect a software engineer to have the same degree of competence over a computing machine.

You won't always need to know how a binary search tree works, but sometimes you do. As a person that conducts interviews at a big tech company, I'm trying to hire someone who I'm confident can make the right decisions and confidently implement or advise on solutions. These things do and have come up in my experience as an engineer. Maybe some software niches don't have the same requirements, and they should meter hiring appropriately. That has not been my experience in my field."
"607","The difference is if a doctor has 20 years experience and he is interviewing for a job he isn't going to be asked about stuff he learned in Medical School. It's just assumed he knows it or knows how to learn it.

He will be asked about his experience, how he applies the latest tools and how he treats patients related to his area. Like for example a dentist, who is a MD and at some point in time cut up cadavers to remove their spleen or whatever isn't going to be asked when s/he joins a dental practice about his/her ability on how to remove an appendix. Even though s/he probably learned that in school."
"608","&gt;I mean I know what a link list is [...] but hell if I remember how to implement it. 

I don't think these two clauses are consistent.  Balancing algos for trees... fine, I get it, but a linked list is just a simplest-possible node (an object with a value and a pointer to another node, recurse as necessary), and some helper functions to find stuff, and add/remove stuff between existing pairs of nodes.

If you need to google that to replicate that in your favorite language, you don't know what a LL is, and if you don't know what a LL is, you won't know when it's a terrible idea to use one."
"609","Implementation would involved all the insert, remove, traverse etc .. functionality that you would want. So yeah I know what a linked list is, I don't know off the top of my head all the functionality needed to implement one. I am not saying google the actual code on a linked list but more of a complete spec of what is required to make a linked list.

A good way to think about it is, you know how to ride a bicycle, but now out of the blue you need to write an essay explaining in detail to someone who has no idea what a bicycle is how to do it. It will take you a few moments to switch your brain so you can work in that mind set and even think of the vocabulary to do it. (actually this would be a better interview question than having someone explain to you what a linked list is)

And before I would use it in my code I would google it and think about if it is the right thing for the task I am using. Anytime I have a complex problem that requires more than basic coding I will google it to see if anyone has done something similar, how and why they did it and is there gotchas to it that I might not be thinking of. If nothing else it might get my brain going in another direction as it reminds me of one of the thousands of things I have learned over the years that is probably a better solution.

Frankly using random data structures in code for the sake of using them is a terrible idea. Just as much as it is using random framework or design patterns. And as someone who works on a lot of legacy code I see that all the time."
"610","A day or two is a long time for something like that. I've definitely had to use these data structures during internships and even my personal life"
"611","I say day or two because I am so used to all the other BS that goes along with a job that to get 3-4 hours of coding takes a day or two."
"612","That makes more sense. I was silently judging thinking you meant 2 full days. That sounds a lot more reasonable. I'm lucky and don't have too many BS meetings and politics to work through at work so I can just get busy. I take it for granted lol

I was going to say, if you know what a linked list is, creating it should be trivial. Maybe a little bit of time if you botch the insert/delete functions. Even then like you said, you could quickly Google psuedo code to follow in whatever language you are using."
"613","This is true.

Obviously it depends on the person who do this, but personally I think that building them from scratch is one of the best ways to understand why some of them are better for certain tasks than others. Where the ups and downs are etc.

However as you stated, most companies won't ask you to implement them, they will just expect you to know which one to use."
"614","I agree that we should know how to build them from scratch, I just personally found that actually drawing it out helps me choose what's best.

Drawing out something to represent data and using arrows to direct how you are adding and accessing it will pretty much make a visualization of the appropriate data structure"
"615","I agree that we should know how to build them from scratch, I just personally found that actually drawing it out helps me choose what's best.

"617","I think the companies are just looking for the lowest common denominator, especially when interviewing someone who is a fresh grad or a very junior dev.

In cases where ppl with solid experience under their belts get drilled on these things especially for positions where this sort of knowledge is not required is beyond me. 

I do ask some basic data structure questions when interviewing ppl - like ""what's a hash in a hashmap"" and then go on to ask about collisions etc, even if they don't know how it's actually impld I just want to see the train of thought. So now if you as a developer for 20 years don't know this I'd just be surprised lol, I mean this can be at play if e.g. you need to impl your own hash code method etc - so it is reasonably relevant to a day to day."
"618","Wow lucky. I got asked implement a HashTable and a Trie for frontend engineer positions shrug"
"619","This is because interviewers are bad at their jobs"
"620","like with a hashing function, re-sizing depending on load factor, and everything? all in a 45(?)min interview?

something like this? https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementing-our-own-hash-table-with-separate-chaining-in-java/"
"621","I thought they were talking about being asked problems that involved those data structures, sometimes multiple. Sometimes interviewers ask you to implement a custom data structure or modify a known one. Ive also never had to create one from scratch on the job but thats swe interviewing for ya."
"622","It's surprisingly common not to see any of those.


However, it's probably going to depend a bit on which area of CS you go into.

The only data structure I've been asked about has been regular arrays. Even then, not about the data structure, just a problem with an Array in it and I did need to know how they worked as well as some logic and loops ofc.

Edit: I've only worked at largeish corporations though."
"623","Not everyone interviews at faang companies. Most of my programming jobs have been analyst jobs that involve programming and the interviews have never been technical."
"624","Interviewed for a mid-sized regular company for a non-entry level position, the technical portion I had to implement a depth first search for a binary tree on a white board, and additionally implement a prime-number checking function. It was basically a fizz-buzz interview, but I was under the impression that it didn't matter how I did on those, they just wanted to hear me talk and write through it.
  
  
I'm curious if a lot of these differences in interview have more to do with geography than the type of company you're interviewing for...
  
  
EDIT: I'm in the Mormon Corridor, who're trying desperately to brand themselves as the ""Silicon Slopes.""
EDIT 2: On reflection, they also asked me compiler level questions."
"625","Possibly. Not OP but I have yet to see algorithm or data structures come up in interviews in Arkansas"
"626","Definitely depends on company. For my online assessments theres usually 1-2 of DP, graph DFS/BFS, 2d matrixes, tries, or BSTs. A few companies pulled out stats, lin alg, and topological sort. These were all for internship positions =-"
"627","Well, you are at uWaterloo and most likely applying for big names company / startups as many waterloo kids does. What you are experiencing is definitely not the norm.

I explicitly avoid those companies as I am too lazy to grind enough leetcode to pass their interview."
"628","Oof. Its starting to sound like internships are banking on you sticking with them through the rest of college due to the requirements for ""entry level"" positions."
"629","Be aware that the guy is from Uwaterloo and their culture / competition is completely different than most other universities even among top Canadian universities. He's probably interning at big tech companies / startups."
"630","Utah, lol?  I just had a bunch of recruiters on here try to sell me and that desperation shone through."
"631","Sounds about right.  
  
I mean, it's  awesome if you're the outdoorsy/snowboardy type, but for most people they'd likely prefer to live and work in other states. The major positives I can say is that I've had a 40 hour work week for almost my entire time here, and we've got fiber internet. I worked for a company out of San Diego and was regularly pushing 60 hours."
"632","Could be, might also depend on the industry and what kind of stuff they work on."
"633","That's probably true as well. I know my network engineering friends interviews all end up sounding like pop-quizzes."
"634","Yeah, sorry, I haven't. I've only had a couple interviews that wanted code samples.
But I've had a lot more questions about, say, experience with cloud architecture patterns, or how I managed logging and monitoring, or how I delivered on business problems.
It might be a different story right out of a degree, where they just want to know if you paid attention in class."
"635","I have *only* been asked about those by Microsoft. Literally no one else in the industry has bothered to ask. This is after dozens of interviews."
"636","What? 90% of my interviews I've at least been asked about data structures, and even had to implement them in some interviews. It's fundamental Computer Science, and I'm worried about all these CS grads who don't seem to be grokking the material at all. People should be taking entire classes dedicated to data structures."
"637","You are aware that most business requirements are best met by solutions that need no algorithmic skills whatsoever, like at all?"
"638","slight generalization?"
"639","Good luck meeting some *real* business requirements with a group of ""engineers"" who don't know their fundamentals. I wouldn't want to work at a place that hires people who don't know CS."
"640","Sorry buddy, but that's just not my experience. And I've done a lot more interesting work than just CRUD apps. 

I'm sure there have been times I could have implement more interesting solutions if I had a stronger traditional CS background. Though from my experience, ""interesting"" solutions are usually the ones you want to avoid ;-)"
"641","Right. Most businesses are powered by a crud app, just saying"
"642","More or less how many interviews have you done if you don't mind me asking?"
"643","Oh man, I've been doing this around 8 years, I'm on my third job, had a small handful of interviews at each change.
Maybe it's different coming right out of a CS degree. I kind of lucked my way into my first position, and then had some concrete work to stand in after that."
"644","That sounds more like a damn great way to fall asleep. OP can't program in the first place, I would rather suggest programming to the point of knowing the difference between an interface and an abstract class before wasting time on implementing more obscure data structures you might need to know about in interviews."
"645","Ha, maybe. But to each their own, eh?"
"646","This is a good list. I had to implement almost all of these in C++ in my data structures class and it really makes you understand how they work under the hood. I can answer pretty much any question about how hash tables or AVL trees work because the code for it is burned into my brain."
"647","Probably overkill. Arrays and HashMaps and Sets will get you 95% of the way there."
"648","Ive implemented those multiple times in the past but theres no way I can write those data structures off the top of my head. I think its unreasonable to expect someone to do so."
"649","Anyone can implement a linked list.  If they say they can't, they're probably just getting tripped up by some language-specific syntax.  A scavenger hunt (the one where each clue tells you where to find the next) is effectively a linked list."
"650","I had one of the better profs for the course and most of my peers in that class seemed to have retained the knowledge, so I think it's just a lack of repetition and practice for me (I took it about a year ago). Thanks for writing out a list of structures to implement!

edit: grammar"
"651","&gt; - an ArrayList, more or less; something backed by an array that resizes itself if you put too much in there

found the java programmer"
"652","That is WAY overkill for just trying to get your foot in the door. You can probably stop at binary tree if you're not applying to the big four. Even then, I would only expect to see directed graphs or avl balanced binary trees very rarely."
"653","Yeah, non-big four here, binary tree was about as far as my last interview went. Binary trees, explaining the difference between DFS and BFS, as well a question on if I could implement another data structure with their generic Node object (you could, it was a Doubly Linked List). It was pretty straight forward, mainly to suss out if I was full of shit or not about what I learned in college."
"654","And this is exactly why the impostor syndrome is so prevalent. Because communities like this upvote posts like his where people are putting more effort into bragging than they are actually explaining the industry. People come here looking for actual industry advice, and they get regurgitated big four factoids instead. It's no wonder people will think they're not up to snuff when someone is telling them that they need to be able to implement directed graphs and avl balanced binary trees on the fly right out of college just to get in the industry."
"655","I guess the community is just hungry for Big Four stuff. I mean, you can have a satisfying life as a programmer anywhere, at any company, and not have to fight the hordes to get noticed by Google-senpai. Not that there's anything wrong with fighting the hordes either, but yeah, it seems to be a theme here."
"656","I don't think it's hunger at all - I think it's circular logic. People upvote those posts because they're most like the posts they've agreed with in the past. They downvote anything outside of that because people use it to justify a very elitist attitude: non-big four jobs aren't ""real"" programming. Of course, very few people here actually have a big four job, but since imposter syndrome is so prevalent... it's a cycle."
"657","I think it absolutely is hunger. A big 4 salary is like a golden ticket to most people into total compensations of almost 200k out of college, why would there not be a huge demand to get in and find out info about them?"
"658","Most people at the big four are not making 200k right out of college. Many people with 5+ years of experience are not making 200k at the big four. The other problem with this reddit is that it tricks people into believing that the highest tiers of compensation are the average."
"659","If you can't get promoted from L3 to L4 in 5 years then the problem is probably on you.

https://www.levels.fyi/"
"660","On the positive side, you're probably smarter than half the people here because you realize it's not some kind of syndrome.  You could start implementing all kinds of different data structures and algos."
"661","This is so frustrating to me. Any time I've ever voiced concerns people are always like ""oh it's just imposter syndrome bro we all deal with it!""

like no dude I'm knowledgeable enough to realize that I LACK knowledge and skill and it makes me worried for my career"
"662","the question around impostor is probably more a ""should I be expected to just solve every problem, know all things and create new ones with my hands in my pocket"" vs ""am I allowed to struggle with some"""
"663","[deleted]"
"664","Right but then when I continually have difficulty applying it and people reassure and say it takes time etc., that's when worry sets in and people regurgitate ""imposter syndrome"" to make you feel better"
"665","Impostor syndrome is real, though, and this reddit is a perfect example. A lot of people get duped into believing that the interview standards used by the big four are industry standards, or that they represent the type of work that actually gets done in the industry. Neither of those are actually true, but if you believe it, you're going to get awfully anxious thinking about trying to climb a ladder in the industry."
"666","A lot of legitimate imposters use imposter syndrome to make them feel better about their own lack of ability. 

We dont have the standards of being an architect or doctor. The industry as a whole really has a massive amount of people who dont know what theyre doing. 

Theres a big difference between a competent frontend software engineer having to whiteboard some leetcode hard graphing algorithms in 30 minutes and the same engineer not knowing complexity analysis, data structures, and practical problem solving skills thats a fundamental part of their profession.

Ive literally interviewed people before who cannot solve fizzbuzz-difficulty problems."
"667","Ive felt this way before. My recommendation is actually to start off with Hackerranks videos on data structures and algorithms (very short, very well explained). Then go from there"
"668","Also they cover really popular interview questions. Their videos are pretty awesome"
"669","Thank you!! This is a great resource."
"670","I *totally* know what the difference between an purely abstract class and interface is, but for someone reading this who doesn't, what is it?"
"671","An abstract class can have method code alongside the method signatures, while an interface is only method signatures.

So you could have a PaymentProcessor abstract class that has a filled-out purchase() method that also calls a filled-out validateUser() method, then calls  signature-only like validatePaymentMethod(), makePurchase(), then calls filled-out methods like handleError(), recordPurchase(), deliverItem().  Such a class would be extended for CreditCard, Paypal, InternalRefund, or Bitcoin subtypes, where you deal with different real-life payment processors (or realistically different vendors).   

Look up Facade or Command patterns in your preferred language for more examples."
"672","So I understand that, but what if all the methods are also abstract and not filled out? Is there really any difference between an abstract class and an interface?"
"673","Semantics. If you're defining an abstract class without any defined methods or stored state, you should probably use an interface instead, to better convey what your actual intention is.

There may be some libraries/frameworks that require interfaces specifically. For example, I believe OSGi requires your class to implement an interface before you can export that as an OSGi service.

Note that as of Java 8, the distinction between abstract classes and interfaces blurs even more, because interfaces can now define default methods."
"674","Oh, I thought you said ""purely"" as kind of a typo, so I ignored that.

If the language permits subtyping identically, there's no difference in the types to me.  I haven't programmed in Java for so long, I couldn't say."
"675","The difference is an abstract class can store state. Methods and fields (static final in java) in an interface are public while abstract classes can use more restrictive levels."
"676","In addition to what others have said, you can have a class implement multiple interfaces, but only inherit up to one abstract class, so there's a benefit to making something an interface if it is appropriate."
"677","No, an abstract class represents _implementation_ which might include state."
"678","Im not sure I understand your reply. Are you saying abstract classes cant or shouldnt contain state?

Abstract classes are definitions. If I define one with class/instance fields then what am I doing wrong?"
"679","You say the difference is that they can store state. That's not what an abstract class is. 

What makes an abstract class different is it contains _implementation_. This can include state. But it's more general than that, and includes method implementation as well."
"680","Ohhh... In my defense, I use Java and default methods allow for implementation in interfaces.

In the case of a purely abstract class and traditional interface what would be their main differences? Im only coming up with scope and flexibility for their implementations."
"681","Somewhat depends on the exact language and rules for Objects for the most part, especially if they allow multiple inheritance. Multiple inheritance can get messy, so a lot of languages only let you inherit from a single class, but your class can implement any number of interfaces. Generally, inheriting from a Class C means A is an C (e.g. a Dog is an Animal), but  implementing an interface I means A can do I (a Dog can Move and Implements Mover, but Cars can also Move, but would be Vehicles). You separate out abilities from your object model which allows for more reasonable expectation of how you design your class structure"
"682","I finally just got this drilled into my head yesterday as a senior because I needed it for a design patterns midterm lol. An abstract class is a class with at least 1 abstract method. An interface is a class with only abstract methods. Every sub class is required to provide an implementation for each abstract method"
"683","So an interface is just a subset of an abstract class basically and there is no true difference if an abstract class has all abstract methods?"
"684","Well, a class can implement multiple interfaces, so there's some benefit to making it an interface."
"685","In addition to the above, in languages such as Java, we can only subclass one class but we are able to implement multiple interfaces."
"686","Abstract classes can store state."
"687","Look, I'm no expert but I think you should just sit down and code. Practice writing a Stack or Queue from scratch, don't just read the defs, actually use them to build something."
"688","I just had an interview yesterday where I couldn't explain difference between interface vs abstract class properly. I felt dumb because it is something I learned in my freshman year. I understand the concepts it's just I am not good at explaining with words."
"689","A good example that helped me would be to have a Vehicle abstract class. Then have Concrete classes such as Car, SUV, Truck, etc. They all inherit functions like drive(), stop() blah blah. Then an interface would be like a set of functionality that a vehicle subclass needs to be guaranteed to have. Like V8Engine and V6Engine interfaces. Which each come with different capabilities.

I also recommend reading Head First Design Patterns. Youll see somewhat less contrived examples."
"690","Let me take a shot here :)

I like to think of it as, purpose-wise they're different, because functionality wise they're becoming more similar.

The biggest difference is, one (abstract) class can implement multiple interfaces, while can only extend a single abstract class. The leads to, interfaces are good at describing behaviors, like a duck can both walk, and quack. But with abstract class, it's more suitable for describing ""what it is"", like a duck is an animal.

There are languages that allow multiple inheritance, like C++ or Python, and in those languages, the term abstract class or the difference there is vague. But if the terms are defined clearly, it shouldn't very hard to tell the difference."
"691","&gt;I legitimately do not understand any data structures 

I seriously doubt this.  Most data structures are VERY simple conceptually.  I believe the problem is how most of them are taught.  I understand things visually, and topics such as data structures can be explained very easily with images whereas written/spoken language makes them insanely complicated.  Once you get into structures outside of 3 dimensions (4-D arrays), they can be hard to grasp functionally though, even if the concept is similar.  

Take a look at these, just looking at the pictures:  [Array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-arrays/), [Linked List](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/linked-list/), [Stack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure/).  Just look at the pictures and read the very brief descriptions.

&gt;unable to explain ""fundamental"" CS concepts to anyone (like abstract classes vs. interfaces - i keep forgetting the differences).

This isn't ""failing to understand"" anything, it's simply a vocabulary problem.  I've got a bachelor's and a master's degree in CS.  When I was taking my final exams for my master's degree, I totally flipped out because the test was only about 12 questions (covering everything in the program), but the questions were things like ""Explain how [*Name of Core Concept*] can be used to solve the problem of [*what you'd use it for*].""  I've never had as much of a feeling of dread as when I was taking that test because there were several of the [*Core Concepts*] that I was completely drawing a blank on, and had no clue what the questions were even talking about.  When I told my professor that I had no clue what the [*Core Concepts*] were, she acted like it was no big deal.  She just told me [*Core Concept*] is [*10 second explanation of what it is*].  She knew I knew the material, and once she reminded me of what it was, I was able to write pages of info about those concepts.  It was simply a vocabulary problem.

And as for the difference between abstract classes and interfaces, I wouldn't consider those ""fundamental"" concepts, and as long as you have the general idea of what they are, you can look up the specifics when you need them.  The real world doesn't consist of ""closed book tests"".  I've got almost 20 years in the field, but I'll still Google stupid simple things like ""how to sort an array in Javascript"".  My head is too full of things like understanding the full conceptual model of a complex 20 table application and the data relationships to worry about the fact that I can't just instantly spit out the best way to sort a Javascript array."
"692","thank you so much - I also learn visually so those links were extremely helpful."
"693","&gt; When I was taking my final exams for my master's degree

Huh... I just did the coursework and graduated (non-thesis track). Some of the courses had finals, but many didn't (with most of the grade being based on a paper or project instead).

Algorithms though... F*** that class. Only one I got a C in (during my MS, my BS had a few more :P). Most of it I kind of got, but it was just time consuming... Like ""Perform the following operations on a red-black tree...."" Even using the book as a reference (open book test) that set of problems alone took a good 20-30 minutes just because of all the re-balancing you'd have to do."
"694","&gt; When I was taking my final exams for my master's degree

I was actually referring to the single, final, comprehensive exam encompassing all of the courses I took. I don't remember which actual courses had final exams, but it certainly wasn't all of them.  But it was the final, ""everything rides on this one test"" exam where this happened."
"695","Ah, yeah, for me Algorithms was one of those classes where a significant part of the grade was the final exam... and it was a required class and anything below a C was failing and a C got you put a warning since you needed a 3.0 cumulative GPA to graduate. It was a very stressful semester :("
"696","Hello,

If you want to learn Problem Solving skills (generic)

"699","Thanks so much, this is an amazing tool!"
"700","You should try to code everyday. Set some time and then sit down and code for that amount of time everyday. Most of these can be learnt theoretically but they will not stick around if you don't practice/use them. Focus on easy problems but play as much as you can with the data structures. In my data structure and algorithms class we had to build linked list, doubly linked list, red black tree, etc. ourselves from scratch, which was an awful lot of work but really helped reinforce the theory. I can always explain the data structures that I have implemented from scratch, at least the idea behind it."
"701","There are plenty of jobs for you where you can be productive in higher level languages without understanding the theoretical CS data structures. If you can get code to do what you want you'll be alright if that's what you're worried about. Yeah it's good to know this stuff but you won't be homeless if you don't"

The most important think for you to focus on now is getting your resume looking sharp, sending copies of it to every corner of the earth, and building confidence in yourself.

Youve gotten this far because youre smart. Just keep chugging. If youre overwhelmed, take a break for a day or two, and do something you enjoy."
"707","It's pretty common. Both in the sense in that feeling this way when it's not true is pretty common, and colleges producing CS students lacking in core CS skills is pretty common.


But good news! I've been employed for quite some time now, and I dropped out, and I can't explain either of those things (I mean, I've *used* them as recently as yesterday, but I'd have to google it for maybe the 5th or 6th time to explain it properly, which is harder than just using them day to day).

Lacking in problem solving skills and

&gt; I've been flunking all technical interviews that ask me questions I haven't seen before.

this are bigger problems, but they're solvable.


So it sounds like you have three problems. Lack of practical experience solving problems, lack of some specific memorization for interviews, and lack of confidence.

-----

So first off, I recommend working on some projects on your own that you don't know how to solve, and solving them without an answer being handed to you. While I generally despise the whole 'leetcode grind' programming solutions to algorithmic problems while forcing yourself not to look up solutions to help you would be good practice.

You need to be able to think through a plausible attempt at answers to questions you don't know how to answer, because you will continue to get pelted with questions you don't know how to answer without a couple hours looking through wikipedia, stackoverflow, or documentation, during interviews.

This is the #1 skill colleges are supposed to teach you (i like to think of the entire college experience as bullshitting 101, although this has more substance than just bluffing) but it doesn't always pan out that way. So, practice practice practice.

Even if you do start racking up leetcode answers, build something on your own from scratch that requires you to work outside your comfort zone and not directly follow any tutorial. If you want to rip your hair out you've picked a good problem. By this I do mean a complete standalone application relevant to the sub-field of CS you want to get into.

Also, hopefully you do know how to code by now, but if your coding skills are lacking, once again full projects are the best method of improvement (unless you're a beginner, then it's tutorials, tutorials on full projects, then full projects).

-----

Ok that handles problem 1.

Problem 2 is you need to memorize some explanations to pointless bullshit for pointless bullshit weeder questions. Do you need to understand interfaces? NO! (well you should but still no). What you need to do is feed the interviewer some bs rote explanation for what they are like you're a living embodiment of the textbook.

Is a good way to answer all questions? Of course not, but it's how you answer these nitpicky knowledge questions that are basically trying to test if you slept through class for 4-5 years.

If you keep getting stumped, try looking for online resources of popular questions and learning the answers (last interview I had I pre-memorized almost half the questions so this works distressingly well), and write down any questions you didn't know the answers to after failing.

Read up on those and try try again.

You don't need to answer every question, but ideally you don't want to flub all of these. It's not that the knowledge for these sorts of questions matters (arguable they should never be asked) but that you get the interviewer to feel good about you, by answering these questions confidently.


-----

So no one can really help you with problem 3, but try and find someone to help you practice interviews, and remember that faking is literally the same thing as making it.

Additionally, knowing the bullshit questions can make you feel better about the whole process. Practice taking a moment to get a deep breath and really think about every question. Not only does that help you, but most people like to see a steady measured approach to each question, combined with neither over nor under explaining it. So give a full explanation, then shut the fuck up no branching into your life story based on someone asking you what your experience is with X (yes people do this, so damn much dear god why).


Try dressing up real nice, overkill for whatever you think is expected by a little bit, make sure you shower and shave super well. Really ultra clean cut even compared to yourself dressing up usually.

Total anecdote but it helps me put on my bullshit confident sales-like persona.



Anyway, this is all my hot take based on personal experience and my general cynicism so grain of salt and all that. It isn't a very controversial set of statements though at least among the people I know."
"708","Practice, Practice, Practice. I had the same issue and the way I got around it was creating a blog. I would try to explain in the blog the concepts I didn't know. Remember, if you can't explain in simple terms then you don't know it well enough.

Start a simple pet project and explain to the most stupid people why you took each step this could help you understand your own logics, if you think you could have done it a better way, make the changes."
"709","Read Cracking the Coding Interview.    
[http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/)  


This should help clarify your understanding."
"710","Try some c++ oop.

You'll see why differentiating interfaces and abstract classes is useful.
And if you see that you'll know the difference forever.

My point is to try to apply your knowledge. Plenty of resources out there for that.

Think about the concepts and try to find examples for their use.

Try to make a point of differentiating similar concepts (types of polymorphism, for example).

That's how I try to study anyways. 

My gpa is mediocre but I do ok in interviews."
"711","Would you like to schedule a 1-1 via skype to talk about this?

I do interviews (on data structures, for applicants at my company) and ""How to tackle your coding interview""  talks at local universities."

I'm on a timezone that I think is the same as Boston massachusetts (Santiago, Chile)"
"717","Yup i PM'd you - I'm in central time, so I think I'm an hour behind"
"718","A lot of people fresh out of college can't do these things. This reddit has a terrible tendency of acting like everyone comes from MIT and works at Microsoft. It'll just take practice. And the best way to get that practice is at a job. I realize trying to get a job is your issue, but just remember that all you're studying for is to get a job. You don't have to worry about showing up to the job already perfect.

You need to make sure you can regurgitate dictionary definitions of the three pillars of OOP, and of Solid principles. You need to be able to go into detail about where you might make use of those. You need to understand arrays and linked lists and basic string manipulation. Hopefully you can at least discuss the basic pros and cons of binary trees and hash tables, but you don't need to be able to implement them. You probably don't even need to be able to actually *use* them. You won't get into Microsoft right out of college like that, but you can hopefully get your foot in the door."
"719","Start with something small like figuring out what a binary tree is. Then traverse it. Then explain it to someone who doesnt know what a binary tree is. Once thats complete, move onto the next data structure. 

Source: I dont know what the fuck data structures are but this is my plan when I am going to leave my company after a year or so."
"720","You're fine--maybe even in a better place than most--because you realize the problem. Now all you need is a solution. Which is not hard to come by. I'd recommend starting with the [Khan Academy Algorithms class](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms) and work your way through that at your own pace. When you're ready to move past that, try other material from the [Open Source University CS repository](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). 

&amp;#x200B;

No big deal"
"721","Thanks so much for those resources, especially the CS repo. Looks very comprehensive &amp; doable!"
"722","To be fair, it's really, *really* common to not understand abstract classes vs interfaces until you actually start developing. Everything you look up tends to spit out the same shallow facts that totally miss the mark, plus the same boilerplate ""iT's A cOnTrAcT"" verbiage without actually telling you shit."
"723","Hey man. As for OOP concepts, It would probably be very helpful for you to work on a project (website, desktop app, game, mobile app, or any kind of software) because having to use these concepts in projects and seeing examples of them implemented will help enforce these concepts and makes them harder to forget. When you use frameworks like the Android SDK for example, you will see how top engineers like the ones at Android use these concepts when building the frameworks. 

As for data structures (linked lists, arrays, BST etc. ), I found this playlist on YouTube by one of india's late top programmers ( humblefool ) where he explains them in a very nice way. The channel's name is: mycodeschool I am sure other channels have very good quality too.

All the best"
"724","Flunking interviews does not mean that you do not know anything. Success in interviews does not only depend on how well you grasp cs concepts. Sadly no school or University teaches how to be good at interviews. You have to be confident and trust what you know and do not know and what you want to know and what you don't want to know. You simply can't master everything as a new graduate and do not try to."
"725","Understand your DS and algos but I wouldnt say understanding interfaces vs abstract classes is important especially if you are applying for jobs that dont have these concepts. Coming from someone who doesnt use these concepts."
"726","Me neither yo, and I've been working in the industry for a year.

Can you give some more examples of questions that stump you? It could be that the questions you are being asked in interviews are more complex than you think.

Also, it might be that the questions are intentionally difficult. It's more valuable to an employer to know how you act when you DON'T know something than knowing that you can answer one question about a linked list or something."
"727","I work by myself so I've pretty much lost all the terminology. I just know how to program well, clean and efficiently while also being easy to understand."
"728","I'm the same and I already graduated last year. I think it's more because it was about minimal retention of the material and after finishing the class, it felt unnecessary afterwards. I'd say just go back to your homework and lectures from those classes and try to redo your assignments and everything until you feel like you've mastered them

But a lot of those things are more for programming and I just got a job in QA."
"729","I dont feel like I actually understood how to code until I started doing it for a living. Perhaps this is a practice thing(I was practicing more at work so I understood it more) . So my advice is pretty much the same as what I see. Just pick a language and start banging out coding problem. Maybe grab the cracking the coding interview book. You can find pirated versions on the internet for sure if you dont want to splurge for it but its probably be worth the money."
"730","Your professors have failed you. Go to the admissions office and ask for a refund for your parents."
"731","I recently graduated, and I think it's pretty natural that you'll forget a lot of the stuff you learned along the way. The only remedy is to review, and to keep working on things to refresh these concepts. Cracking the Coding Interview gives a good summary of the things you should know for getting-a-job purposes, and provides resources on where to go when you don't know/remember things. Keep in mind that CTCI is targeted at experienced engineers, and even they need reminders on this stuff. 

Really there is nothing to it but to just dive in, and keep going until you're competent. A good place to start would be to make a list of essential data structures and hit up resources (YouTube, your textbooks, various learn CS online sites) until you understand the What, Why, and How of each of them (and can implement from scratch). Next up, I'd say dive into LeetCode - you'll suck at first, but keep going! Applying your data structures and algorithms knowledge to actual problems will help you cement what you've learned."
"732","Well, donno how you made it so far, but congrats.

Personally, I don't consider OOP concepts like abstract classes vs interfaces ""fundamental"" at all. Abstract classes, interfaces, and all that stuff are only about organizing code. Useful in software engineering and maintaining large codebases, but nothing directly related with CS. IMO the only way to truly ""get it"" is to experience it first hand when you can no longer keep the logic of your few-hundred line school projects in your head.

As far as algorithms and data structures, just go grind [CTCI and Leetcode](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6rzl94/yet_another_help_im_drowning_post/dl9mrgg?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) properly."
"733","[deleted]"
"734","IMO these are far from good ideas to *learn* about data structures. The questions are meant to be ""hard"" (even the ones marked as easy). It's better to just look on youtube IMO someone who can explain the different data structures"
"735","I know he mentioned Data Strucutres but in my opinion that isn't going to help him learn OO principles like Abstract or Protected classes or interfaces etc.

I think this is bad advice you're offering because you're acting like the majority of companies ask Leetcode style questions. 


He should be able to explain Data structures and OO concepts in interviews which can easily be achieved by brushing up on the material and by practicing implementing them."
"736","I think those sites distracts genuine learners with a disguised sense of making ""progress"". Ambitious learners easily feel compelled to move fast with the complexity of the problems, or feel obligated to pass all tests."
"737","Everyone is ignoring the fact that this guy also said youtube videos. Learning theory and putting it into practice is the way to learn, which is what this guy is recommending xd"
"738","&gt; i'm almost done with my CS degree but I legitimately do not understand any data structures

lol how is that even possible? like let's say here's an array, it's a data structure... you don't understand how those work? not talking memory representation etc, just straight up array as a concept/programming language construct."
"739","Sounds like your degree was a waste of time/money."
"740","Why not stay in desktop software? Not everything can or should be browser based."
"741","I don't know... I saw an AWS whitepaper that said everything should be in the cloud."
"742","Big surprise, a cloud services company says everything should be in the cloud.

Even taking into account the massive growth of cloud based services, theyre not all web apps."
"743","Yeah no shit AWS would say that lol. Its called marketing."
"744","Sadly, too many jobs these days all involve cloud servers . But, there is nothing to say you cannot develop desktop software with a cloud back-end either.  I even think with the flaws of the modern web browser (that still has ancient HTML/JS technology) that people may one day migrate back to cross platform desktop apps."
"745","I mean most client-facing software is moving to the web. There really is no fighting it. So yes, whether you are backend or frontend developer, you need some knowledge of web development. Also, most software is legacy software rather than greenfield projects.  

Embedded might be a possible option I think."
"746","You definitely do *not* need web skills.

""Backend developer"" (data engineer, ML engineer, infrastructure engineer, etc., etc., etc.) is a thing for a reason.  

What you *do* need (to remain competitive in a generic sense) is the knowledge to work in ""the cloud"", i.e., with modern software.  This could mean that you know web dev skills...or it could mean that you're fluent/knowledgeable of how to build microservices, architect large, scalable data pipelines (e.g., Spark or Beam), large, scalable infrastructure (e.g., Kubernetes), etc.

No need to take my word for it...go look at job postings for non-frontend // non-fullstack roles; they will exclude Angular and all that jazz for a reason (i.e., specialization)."
"747","Sadly, in Nashville where I live I cannot find a damn thing that isn't cloud based job. I am utterly sick of this whole JS Clientside framework revolution.. Where people seem so married to a JS stack because they just keep breaking or one suddenly had a better idea and now the others just become obsolete and unsupported. As some said, front end dev is the Wild WEst, but it seems most jobs want you to be a back-end, front-end and web designer all-in-one.

I am thinking I will be leaving Nashville and see if I can find a city that has more back-end type jobs.  I think I can apply my desktop development skills to the back-end world more.  Most jobs are web jobs unless I want to get into low level device programming or stuff like that.  I am thinking about trying to hone me C++ skills again.  I have done quite a bit of C++ programming over the years.  

I am a .Net Developer , so the various Java frameworks I am pretty ignorant about.  I don't have so much time , but I would definitely like to pick up as much skills for back-end development as possible . I do feel the back-end is my passion.  I utterly hate HTML/CSS!  Having to intermix script with that crap just makes me go ill :p"
"748","&gt;To echo  [farmingvillein](https://www.reddit.com/user/farmingvillein/), I'm in Kentucky and a lot of the jobs I see are backend/infrastructure but are going to involve cloud services/writing web APIs. But not any front end JS stuff. I think you could position yourself pretty well for that kind of thing."
"749","Thanks for your response flight19.. You know I just posted a reddit post asking a question about a career more focused on cloud technologies, but sadly, it quickly went down the quagmire of cs career question posts, because I posted it late in the evening.. Nobody saw it. Here is the link.

"750","No. But its pretty easy to learn these web stacks. Some familiarity with them is fine when applying for new jobs. Programming is programming. If you master the basics its easy to pick up new languages."
"751","Focus on leetcode and nothing else because nothing else matters for FAANG"
"752","lol"
"753","Having canned STAR interview responses are pretty useful too"
"754","So fucking true. I wish I wouldve stayed on it for the past 6 months when I realized that I wanted to leave my company. I didnt even know what leetcode was until I BOMBED my first amazon OA"
"755","Learn C because C just came out last year"
"756","Don't stop leetcoding, because being able to pass interviews is peace of mind and freedom.

The rest of it will come through work, but continuing to do interview prep is something you'll forget after a few years and it's painful to get started again."
"757","I'd probably master C and with it every algorithm possible

master linear algebra and discrete math

those for a start"
"758","Why C? Why not C# or more high-level languages?

We will be taking discrete math soon and I will sign up for more math courses. I want to learn more about machine learning and AI, but it seems like you need a lot of experience in math."
"759","because, with C you are learning how to program right at the machine level, not how to use libraries and frameworks and pre-written routines, it is the nuts and bolts of logic that you can then adapt to absolutely anything that comes after

a good C programmer can learn how to program in C# quite easily, a C# programmer might have a lot of trouble trying to figure out C"
"760","&gt; C you are learning how to program right at the machine level

I am your future self telling your present self to learn both C and microarchitecture better."
"761","I mean when it comes to C-based languages it is the closest to machine level. You get less of the hand holding on memory management and access than you would from its derivatives"
"762","I never even thought of this. Ive hinged on a lot of c++ standard library to do my dirty work for me."
"763","Soft skills, dealing with other people with ""unique"" personalities.

Stress management, everyone will experience stress as early as College and that will continue through out your career. I've seen many people get burned out. I wish Colleges offer a course that help address stress."
"764","Start sooner. I started at 28"
"765","Data structures. Data structures. Data structures."
"766","Learn how to use cloud providers as well as possible, it is the future of backend (more like the present now)"
"767","&gt; Has anyone ever actually been able to make that pivot? Where thinking of everything and knowing what questions to ask actually comes naturally?  

I do not think it came naturally for me, rather I learned it. What you are essentially asking is how to perfect your Google-fu, because as a software engineer, you need to know how to find the correct information using the right search terms.  

I do not really have much advice except practice. Practice googling whenever you get stuck."
"768","Honestly, not even Google Fu, just getting to the point where it occurs to me that it's something I should Google, if that makes sense."
"769","For me a lot of times it's curiosity. If I hear some topic that I don't know much about and think it might be worth it to know or interesting, I'll google it."
"770","Go to school"
"771","Lol, got that down. Thank you"
"772","College"
"773","Well it sounds like you probably know quite a bit about building applications in .Net environments aside from just knowing C# you probably have some idea of how software projects are actually designed and built. Those engineering and architecture skills are what, in my opinion, really matters here and they're not language or framework specific. I feel pretty strongly that good engineers should be able to pick up a give tech stack with relative ease and the reason you hire them isn't because they're good at C# or JS but because they're good at solving problems.    


So I'd say sharpen your DS and Algo skills and spend some time reviewing things like design patterns, getting more in depth on a tech stack you already know pretty well is essentially locking yourself in to very specific roles. Google, Facebook, Amazon etc... don't hire people (except in very specific cases) who are Java, or PHP experts they know that you can easily pick up those language skills they hire people who understand CS and Software Engineering outside of the context of a single language or framework."
"774","I totally agree. But the way I see it. Regular companies ask questions which are mostly tech stack based. If I want to get a better paying job I will have to brush up my tech stack. 
BUT, if I want to get a really well paying job at big companies like amazon or netflix or something. I will have to dig into algorithms. I do not know if at this point i should even bother going that way. There are young lads who have been practicing algos throughout their term at college and after.  Of course Facebook wants to hire them. They are smart and young.  Me? I am about 30. I believe they would have mich higher hopes from me. They would probably expect someone with 7 yrs of experience to bring along solid technology stack knowledge as well."
"775","I worked for 4 years building .Net apps at a consulting company and came in as an mid level engineer to a Big N, I brought in my understanding of how to build systems but I had never written a line of code in the languages prevalent at my current company. Yeah I had to buckle down crack open some textbooks from college and implement a bunch of stuff I'd not seen in 6 years but it's without a doubt made me a better more well rounded engineer I also used Pluralsight's  architecture and design courses to better understand how to ""talk the talk"" for the stuff I'd been doing in my previous job.   


  
The best people on my team (our more senior engineers) came in at 30+ years old from a variety of backgrounds, games, consulting, etc... You have a ton to offer these ""top"" companies don't count yourself out because you think you're too old."
"776","Well thank you! That is encouraging. : )"
"777","Which pluralsight architecture and design course?"
"778","* Clean Architecture
* Encapsulation and SOLID
* Microservices Architecture
* Product Owner Fundamentals - Product Ownership from the Trenches
* Product Owner Fundamentals - Foundations of Product Ownership
* Design Patterns Playbook: Structural Patterns
* Design Patterns Library

I took all of those, some of them I just listened to while walking my dog or at the gym some of which I took sitting down taking notes.

There are probably newer courses on there that are also great."
"779","Cheers for this."
"780","Regular companies? Some unicorn-wanna-be (actually 2 of them) asked me to solve Boggle problem on the phone screening. Not even in house. Thats DFS plus Trie if you want to be precise. Some ask DP questions. And then they pay you half what Google does. So yeah. Regular companies are not so regular anymore. At least in NYC"
"781","I'm in a similar boat. I'm self taught, and my academic knowledge is severely lacking. Yet I can, and have built many applications. I did run through an algos/ds interview before, and with some cramming a few weeks prior, I think I did recently well (they told me it was a culture fit issue. I answered that I got into programming because it seemed like a lucrative career and with good benefits, they wanted me to say I've loved computers from the womb haha). 

So far I've done pretty well for myself. I've managed to rise up relatively quick into the six figure mark, but yeah that 200k+ is still a far away dream. However it does seem like the way to get there is to start getting better at the algos/ds stuff. 

I guess I'm comfortable now, but as things get better, it appears that you'll need more skills to stay relevant. At my first job, we had a very old intern, who had left the industry during the 2000 crash and got into real estate. It was around 2015, and he wanted to come back in. He was interning doing HTML+CSS psd -&gt; wireframe stuff. He knew absolutely no JS. However he told me at one point he was making around 100k, cranking out HTML +CSS documents.... I'm worried I'll end up like him"
"782","Why are you worried? Isn't 100k good? (genuine question since I don't understand foreign currency well)"
"783","For cscareerquestions? Nah. 
On a more serious note though, total comp for experienced devs is at least double that in the Bay Area."
"784","FAANG for sure, but total comp for experienced devs outside of those major companies in the Bay Area is more around $130k-$240k. I do realize the upper range is double what youve put down, Im just saying you see a lot more in the middle of that, like $140k-180k range, than you do these massive quarter million a year packages. Theres a lot of devs out here, and those packages are really competitive, so you get plenty of people settling for smaller offers from smaller companies too."
"785","For sure. Something else no one seems to talk about is that often the work life balance at big firms isnt too great. Yes youre working with the best, youre sometimes working on really dope projects, but they know that. And they work your ass off. Ultimately a good work life balance is more important to me. Outside of FAANG I think its relatively do about to hit the mid-high 100s and thats what Im shooting for in the next few years"
"786","Eh, I suppose I should've been more specific. By ""experienced"" I meant senior engineer, and they definitely make 200 here. Faang would be 300+."
"787","What?  Where exactly? Like in SF the city itself.  I mean even Glassdoor etc probably disagree with you."
"788","Tech is littered all over from SF to SJ, so wherever you live that is comfortable commuting to it.  Some (like FB) are opening offices in east bay too, so really just the entire bay area.

Glassdoor, I'm not sure why, is quite ridiculous in understating total compensation.  Levels.fyi is a much better, up-to-date, and accurate site for compensation values.  https://www.levels.fyi/?compare=Uber,Lyft,Apple,Facebook,Google&amp;track=Software%20Engineer"
"789","Ohhh, you're including RSUs, stock, etc.  Hmm... Will take a look at levels.fyi"
"790","oh. I see. So I guess I should be practicing algos and ds then?"
"791","This. Its not bad, Im going really well. Specially considering I have no debt other than a normal car. But I would eventually like to be making that super dough. But really I just wanna reach financial independence and I wanna retire early. The idea of sitting at a desk 8hrs a day for the rest of my life has me suicidal"
"792","&gt;The idea of sitting at a desk 8hrs a day for the rest of my life has me suicidal

Get a standing desk then."
"793","Let me rephrase, the idea of being inside during the best part of the day, giving up my healthiest years, and not doing the things I want to do (or limited to at best a few weeks a year) has me suicidal. The only way I see out is to increase my salary as aggressively as I can, and using that to achieve a position of being financially independent. Then its off to the mountains, and if I never have to write another line of code in an open office surrounded by marketers, well thatll be alright by me"
"794","Sorry, I was just making a bad joke, but I do get where you are coming from. There was a time where I would keep an empty box under my desk at work just in case I decided to walk out. I never did actually walk out of a job (I probably wouldn't have been able to afford to walk out), but it was nice to have that box there because it gave a false sense that I had some sort of control over my situation."
"795","No worries my dude! Damn that hit home. I feel that. May you be in control one day, best of luck"
"796","Lmfao"
"797","They meant back before the dotcom crash the person was making $100k doing HTML development.  In 2015 he was an intern trying to get back into web development."
"798","Yep. thanks for clarifying! Im already starting to see a bit of a similar trend with more traditional CMS- focused developers. Jobs seem to be shrinking(or theyre all sweatshop agency work), or they pay shit. Glad I left the Drupal-sphere"
"799","Need to find jobs in the microservices back end with go/java/python/nodejs or front end with react/vue. Those seem to be the hot ticket right now. Anything along PWA/web app development, especially react based UIs with nodejs, and golang is on the rise too for back end work."
"800","As someone who's far away from the US, the techs in demand (at least based on this sub) always surprise me. Here in Hungary (working for an international company, developing for other international companies though), in the enterprise space, GO, Python and Vue are not really a thing. Neither are back end and front end devs. What seems to be the safe bet is to learn full stack, specifically Angular + REST API in .NET or Java, and have at least a basic understanding of SQL (so be able to write fairly simple stored procedures for example). Even in a microservice architecture, you'll be usually given tasks in several modules which are built by using different techs.

Newer, small companies tend to offer front end or back end positions and there might be some jobs outside of the above tech stack, but if you want to chase the big money (without stepping on the entrepreneur route), then learning something like python is basically shooting yourself in the foot around here."
"801","I agree with Java or .NET on the back end for API development.. that seems to be the vast majority of choice as many rely on the longevity of those languages and the plethora of developers that know it. I don't know about Angular any more though for front end. Maybe to maintain an older app, but React and Vue seem to be by far the most in demand for front end work. I have also seen a few of that new web objects or whatever it is called. Not much though."
"802","Yeah pretty much nailed it. Id summarize that as you need to be developing applications not configuring premade content management systems"
"803","Oh shucks!"
"804","&gt; Regular companies ask questions which are mostly tech stack based. 

Not necessarily my experience, but anyway data structures and algorithms knowledge can help with language trivia too.  Like, how many .NET collection types can you think of?  A lot of people don't get a lot further than dictionary, array, and list, but there are tons of them, and their intended uses are more obvious if you've spent any time learning about data structures (like, why would you use a hashset instead of a list?  Easier to explain if you're familiar with the underlying concepts)."
"805","The big five don't care about your tech stack skills. Most of them have their own in-house tech stacks. They care about transferable skills like being able to build and maintain high quality software. Unfortunately, that's hard to evaluate at scale, which is why they ask algorithm questions.
If you think you are a good engineer, and you are good with people, go apply."
"806","I would counter that hiring managers don't know that the ability to architect real solutions is what really matters. No one cares what you can realistically build, if you can't inverse a tree structure in the smallest amount of time and do it using the one specific framework that they use and recognize. Though it may be different with people who have experience in many languages instead of being shoehorned for years on a single unchanging stack."
"807","I mean understanding how to inverse a tree demonstrates that you have an understanding of fundamental CS concepts, though if someone told me to do it in a specific language or framework I'd say that's pretty unfair. 

It's not hard to do coding interviews in language you don't write, a good candidate will be able to walk you through the code and the principles are so similar across modern languages it's pretty rare something comes out of left field. I typically have candidates pick a language their comfortable in and follow along from there."
"808","I've been an Android Developer for about 4 years now and 99% of the time I'm architecting solutions, not reversing a fucking tree. This sub places way too much value on ds/algo; sure, Google cares, but most other companies don't"
"809","The context of this was working at Big N or other large tech companies, because that's where I work and those are the interviews I conduct. I think a lot of people come in here and say ""you never use leetcode in real life"" but I certainly have run across the problems in my day to day, additionally while I spend most of my time building or architecting software and not worrying about run time knowing how to recognize a pattern I've seen before and solve it efficiently is important.   


It's not that reversing a tree is important to have memorized precisely, it's getting a bit of business logic realizing that it is under all the business logic inherently just inverting a tree or a moving window problem or a topographical sort etc... and understanding how to  solve that."
"810","It might demonstrate understanding, but it's also a skill that will not come up in any job after you graduate from university making it effectively useless to know. I've never seen a company willing to interview candidates that didn't already know the exact language they were hiring for; those with extensive experience in something else need not apply."
"811","&gt; but it's also a skill that will not come up in any job after you graduate from university

I've not found this to be the case, the interview question I use for onsite loops is actually something I solved on the job not long ago.   


&gt;I've never seen a company willing to interview candidates that didn't already know the exact language they were hiring for

Big N and other large tech companies hire for engineering roles regardless of language or tech stack background."
"812","&gt; etty rare something comes out of left field. I typically have ca

So you are saying I should be focusing on algos?"
"813","Yes, at least that worked for me"
"814","Cool. Thank you!"
"815","&gt; they're good at solving problems

Anyone want to provide input on this? Tech skills aside, how do i get better at solving problems?"
"816","Experience is usually the best teacher here, solving problems in this sense is the ability to:

* Interface with non technical teams and stakeholders,  
* Understand the problem that they are struggling with 
* Identify  the root cause, not just the symptom they are complaining about
* Then design and implement a technical solution to it.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a mixture of soft skills and engineering that you can read about in case studies but actually working on projects with other people is the best way to learn."
"817","very few places will hire you based on ""general software engineer skills"". if you look at most job posting, most of them require experience in a very specific set of skills. i'm running into a ton of rejection on my second job search because i don't have the exact literal years in the literal skills they want."
"818","Large companies tech companies usually don't care about specific language or stacks in my experience. That said you're right in that smaller companies or companies that have a lot of legacy systems will often look for specific languages or frameworks. I was speaking more in regards to OP wanting to work at a large tech company."
"819","What makes you not ""good"" enough to get in Google?

New Grads can even get in Google. 
You have 7+ years of experience. That's awesome. 
If you do desire to get in Google / FAANG, just grind leetcode problems. So, yes, you should start practicing DS and Algo if you're not content at where you are."
"820","&gt; grind leetcode problems. S

I am in a situation where I MUST make more money. Or things will start to fall apart in coming years. 

I am willing to do that grind. But just not sure in which direction. 
With 7 years of experience their expectations would be sky high."
"821","1. There are almost definitely junior engineers at Google who make more than you

2. You don't have to interview for a senior position. Yes, generally, 7yoe candidates get the senior loop. You are welcome to have an open conversation with your recruiter about how you may not have the experience to live up to a senior role. They would not mind slotting you for a mid level role."
"822","[deleted]"
"823","I've worked with junior devs at the age of 40 who made a late transition to CS. Also, you do realize that in any team, you aren't restricted to interacting with people at the same level? You're collaborating with people across all levels who will invariably come from a larger age range. It's not like all the senior devs put the junior devs on one kiddy project or some shit."
"824","Yep agreed. And I shouldn't use that as an excuse for not trying.
Thank you =
"
"825","Good luck!"
"826","&gt; I've worked with junior devs at the age of 40 who made a late transition to CS.

As an (almost) 40 year old transitioning to CS this took a weight off my chest."
"827","I've worked with junior devs and undergrad students that were in their 30s, had kids, etc. There's no limit."
"828","The idea is you have the experience already to get promoted faster, maybe you'll be a senior in two years.

It would be silly if the 22 year olds out-sped you in career growth :)"
"829","They wouldn't know. Level/title is not too easily accessible."
"830","Well you could always shoot for a lower level position within google. They probably pay pretty well.

&amp;#x200B;

Also get rid of this mentality that ""I may never get good enough to get a job at Google"". Being good at tech interviews is like 5% intelligence and 95% grinding Leetcode problems. Trust me, if you do enough of them you will start to see similarities between all the questions."
"831","You mean tech interviews at FAANG companies. Many others will have no leetcode problems"
"832","This is not true. I noticed even small companies in Greater Toronto Area start using HackerRank  pre phone interviews or on-site interviews. I think many companies have bought the idea that if FAANG hire this way it must be best way. But at the same time if you ask 95k oh that's too high for us."
"833","I have had plenty of interviews and have never had this. For large companies.

Worked at two of the largest fin tech companies in the US and didnt get it."
"834","That's encouraging. Thank you. I willing to do the grind. I was just unsure , in which direction.
I have just started out with a course on Udemy on ds and algorithms. Do you have any roadmaps or recommendations for me?"
"835","DS and algorithms course is nice, but nothing compares to just going to  [https://leetcode.com/interview/](https://leetcode.com/interview/) and just doing 1 assessment per day.

You have to really try on every problem (never quit before time is up). Even if you just get the brute force solution that's OK. After the problem is done, look at other submissions and try to understand why they are more efficient.

It's like going to the gym. You can read about different training programs but you won't see any progress unless you actually lift something.

&amp;#x200B;

And finally, figure out if you really want to work at FAANG. There are plenty of other companies that pay a lot of money and are easier to get into, especially with your experience."
"836","Who cares about FAANG as long as other companies pay very good money if not as much as FAANG."
"837","My man, thats the right attitude. Prestige doesnt fill my bank account"
"838","Agreed"
"839","what kind of non-FAANG companies give good compensation and are willing to hire Canadians?"
"840","[deleted]"
"841","I see your point, but I was specifically talking about those companies. There are other companies that offer similar benefits and packages, you just wont have the same bragging rights. For example there are some defense contractors paying out the ass, with good benefits, who also hire really smart people. So with that in mind, the only differentiator of a FAANG becomes prestige."
"842","Lmao. Imagine saying this about FAANG companies when Amazon is included in the list."
"843","This is the mindset I have adopted. Younger guy here looking to increase my salary as I also need to increase or things will fall apart. I don't really care about FANG and showing everyone how cool I am because of where I work. 

I just want that FANG kind of salary so I can take care of my family. I don't care if its at some place no one has ever heard of."
"844","&gt; Being good at tech interviews is like 5% intelligence and 95% grinding Leetcode problems

What about personal software projects? (And i don't mean copy and paste tutorial stuff) Can they replace a lot of Leetcode practice?"
"845","Personal projects will help you learn new frameworks and honestly are a much better indicator of software engineering skills.

But sadly, they won't help you with technical interview questions. It sucks because leetcode questions are rarely applicable to real software projects."
"846","They will help you get past the resume screen but not the interview. Many FAANG interviewers dont even look at your resume."
"847","r/financialadvice and r/personalfinance may help the underlying issue"
"848","It depends which role and seniority you apply for. 

If you approach it like a career transition (from corporate IT to Engineering), it may help you develop a study plan and frame your experience during the interview."
"849","No, a faang will ""downlevel"" you (aka, put you at the appropriate level) if you get an offer. You'll interview at L4 level for Google, even if there are people there at L5 with 5 years of experience. 7 years of experience at small scale is not the same thing as in faang. They may even downlevel you to L3. That'll be good since you'll make more than you do now, though being same level as new grad will kind of suck after a while.

But if you get in, you won't have 6 months to dick around learning how to write unit tests or design a basic piece of software. You should already know that part."
"850","That's probably very true."
"851","&gt;With 7 years of experience their expectations would be sky high.

You have 7 years working experience and after that you started working with the basics. That seems impressive enough. Don't get discouraged, they aren't the most difficult topics. If you really want to learn you will have to exercise though, because if you don't you will easily forget the stuff. The idea isn't that you are the master of DS or algorithms, but to have a better grasp of what things you can do. In the event that you ever need to use any of the tricky stuff you learn in such courses, you can just google about it. The thing is that if you didn't know anything about it in the first place, would you know what to look for? 

That goes for every single foundation course on a CS major, systems software, computer architecture, networks, operative systems, databases, programming language design, software engineering, compilers, security, etc.

You don't need to be the master of anything, but it is extremely useful to know what tools you have as a software engineer.

&amp;#x200B;

All of that being said, I would encourage to start with DS and algorithms. Do it at your own pace, maybe a chapter of CLRS every two weeks, focus on understanding what is going on, do a little implementation, and try to find when those things you learn about could be useful.

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck. And just FYI, if you ever pass the online code challenge for a software engineering position, a coding interview is just you showing the other person in the room that you can communicate your ideas, you can ask questions and that you know the basic tools to solve a problem. The idea of a problem isn't to fuck you, it is a framework for you to show how competent you can be (and of course, questions are allowed, an interview is not a paper quiz)."
"852","..."
"853","No not because of any woman. But because I have a sister who has severe autism. She needs constant looking after and my mom is not getting any younger. I need to be able to hire a full time maid or something. If not now then in a couple of years."
"854","Sorry to hear this! Good luck with your efforts!"
"855","The best option then is to attempt to break into one of these really big companies, do what's needed to move up or move up by switching jobs, and target an office that's not in a super expensive location if possible

If money is what you want, FAANG is the safest bet (taking into account how hard it is to get into anywhere that pays more, or that some companies who pay more don't have public stock)"

He studied a long time for the interview, but he himself explains that you don't need a long time to be ready. I'd say grind Leetcode for two months and then try and if you fail learn from your mistakes and keep trying."
"857","Thank you man! I needed this article. Thank you so much. :)"
"858","Glad it helped you :)"
"859","Depends on where you want to work, if it's a Faang company then spending time on ds and algo along with scalable system design would be the best way to spend your time. I'm sort of from a similar background as you .NET developer, except not as much experience. 2.5 years and never learned ds and algo. I went through the process of self teaching python and ds and algo and trust me that having experience helps a ton in terms of understanding the concepts. I feel that i picked up the concepts a lot quicker than say someone learning it for the first time in college just because of my work experience. Also with 7 years of experience faang companies will have system design rounds so would also look into studying that in parallel if you want to get started. Feel free to message me if you want more info on how to dive into some of this stuff if this is the route you chose to go."
"860","Thank you ! : )"
"861","\+12 years here, enterprise software mostly, I only practice a bit before interviews.

other than that, I try to apply what I learn whenever I see the opportunity, for example right now I'm changing our synchronous reporting service to an async model using message queuing and push-pull notifications, first time doing this but  i've read enough to feel confident"
"864","Thanks for sharing the links =M"
"865","&gt; Or should I spend my time on learning algorithms and stuff? I do not have a lot of free time on my hands so I can not pick both.

It's a good bang for your buck to learn the most common/""classic"" algorithms and data structures.  You can spend a week or two and have a lot of the most important and useful knowledge you need to apply to various applications.

It's the kind of thing that sticks around abstractly in your brain as well, not like forgetting syntax that happens almost immediately when you're not using it."
"866","I'm also a self-taught guy who was working before I studied any of the theory.  You should absolutely do it.  It'll really make a difference in the way you approach problems and the kind of problems you're able to solve.  Plus, data structures and algorithms today look very similar today to the way they did decades ago.  Who knows how popular .NET and angular will be in a decade or two?  That knowledge will apply to any language you choose to work in."
"867","I guess if nothing else, learning  ds and algorithms may atleast ensure that i will have one less thing to worry about when preparing for job change"
"868","Any time you've encountered a problem where your app is running too slow, or the code feels a bit cumbersome, there's a good chance that a stronger grasp of data structures or algorithms would help.

Absolutely yes, you should learn them.

And just like anything else that is hard to do, it will feel at first like it's just not your thing, but practice and exposure will make it a bit easier over time and eventually, second nature."
"869","Do you have any roadmaps? Any recommendations? 
I have just started with a course on udemy on ds and algorithms"
"870","I highly recommend the Harvard CS50 course. It is an introductory Computer Science course that covers data structures, algorithms, and a lot of basic computing knowledge that you usually just miss out on if you are self taught, like I was, and like I'm guessing you are.

All of the lectures are freely available online, and they are very high quality, as one would expect from Harvard."
"871","Yes.I am self taught. 

I am so gonna be watching it.  Thank you so much."
"872","30 is not even old for CS careers. I think thats the majority age range for any senior engineer which can be considered somebody with 4-7 years of experience. Algorithms and data structures is what makes you a software engineering, throwing together code because you know a framework just means you know how to throw things together. Understanding how they work and why they work AND being able to implement it (even if it means having to lookup the syntax or documentation) is what differentiates engineers and scientists from code monkeys. Put in the time to improve you engineering skills rather than code monkey skills.

Think of it as comparing a hacker to a script kiddie. Congrats you can follow instructions on how to run other peoples scripts or use tools developed by others on Kali Linux. But do you understand what theyre doing and why? Thats what makes you valuable"
"873","Agreed. I think i should dive into ds and algorithms. Someone on Reddit has even suggested that i should learn C language. Because languages such as C# hide the good stuff. It might take me forever since I have a full time job"
"874","C is a great language to learn because you understand more of the process happening. Funny enough its easier to read that languages like java or but not funny when you have to write 10x as much to do things that java and Python can handle in one or a few lines. But its the difference between knowing what youre doing and getting something done"
"875","I see. I guess I will be wandering at udemy and pluralsight looking for C courses"
"876","Balancing work and self education is difficult so make sure to set yourself up a schedule and stick to it so you can balance work, family and self studying. 

People just like you have managed to improve and get into google from nothing in 6 months. Saw some stories on Leetcode of electrical engineers with minimal programming skills able to do it, so you can too. Learn the theory of data structures and algorithms, and put it to use in leetcode! Theres a learning curve for everything but if youve made it this far in CS, you can surely continue."
"877","Thank you. I guess I did the right thing posting this on Reddit."
"878","&gt; Someone on Reddit has even suggested that i should learn C language.

Do not spend your time on learning C if your goal is to end up in a job that pays the big bucks. It is definitely a great language to learn to become a better programmer, but it's hard to interview in. It's all about grinding leetcode to get into companies that pay top dollar. I would stick to C# since you already know the language and focus on the DS&amp;A part. Most companies will let you pick the language you want to interview in as long as it is not something obscure. Python, Java, C# and JavaScript are most people's go to."
"879","If you want to learn a language that forces you to write memory safe stuff, learn Rust. Lots of folks are starting to use it in production too. There's also sane B-tree implementations in Rust too, unlike C. =
"
"880","This is exactly where I am. 7 years of work experience, but my degree was in EE, so I never really took the harder programming classes in school. My problem is, work just doesn't feel fulfilling unless I'm being challenged, and I don't want to stagnate. So personally, I've been working on them just to broaden my understanding, and cross my fingers that maybe someday it'll lead to an opportunity."
"881","Best of luck mate."
"882","Google will focus more on system design if you have more experience"
"883","How do you learn or improve upon that? Any recommendations? Links?"
"884","Im not sure if someone else has recommended it, but [The System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) on GitHub is a great resource."
"885","Thank you. I was not aware of it."
"886","https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRPMAqdtSgd0Ipeef7iFsKw This guy's channel is good.  But don't get the wrong idea, you'll still want the DS/A knowledge too"
"887","Thank you for sharing that link.
I will look into ds and algos first before diving into  system design"
"888","Yes, but they will most certainly require their senior engineer to master DS&amp;A as well."
"889","You should know basic data structures and basic algorithms. They're not hard to learn, especially with the resources available today. You can learn for like an hour a day or just 3 days of the week. Within a month you'll be sailing.

 As a Jr dev when I look at legacy code at my firm, some of it is just widely inefficient. Like nested for loops galore. I got tasked for a few months optimizing/refactoring old legacy code and it was a bit painful. Team leads were surprised at some of the optimization gains in some parts of the product and I was like ""I just copy/pasted some algorithm"" and they nodded.

Good example was when our client started to send millions of requests DAILY. Typically our product only had to deal with at most 200K requests in a day and that was the extreme. Shit broke so fast. Took months to find all these inefficiencies and bad stuff. Our product is meant to be distributed but it's not scalable at all (YIKES). So we implemented some async libraries to deal with the requests and shit got so much better."
"890","The thing is after a point, you are anyway good at those things without remembering all those algorithms about how you can find the largest sum in an array without using constant space in 45 mins. In real life therere more variables than those tech rounds. 
Its obvious that you should know about complexities in general, however, it should not be just to clear those interviews. Learning about those things in start of your career make sense, but when youre already 7+ years, you should be spending this time in learning higher level things which can improve your productivity directly. That doesnt mean you still write code that runs for O(n^2) in production (whos reviewing those PRs)."
"891","Here's a datapoint for you: 34 yrs old. Worked at xyz large enterprise software company for 5 years, which is my only experience in software (entered the field late).

Decided to systematically approach studying for interviews about 8 months ago (1 or 2 hrs a day, top ranked leetcode problems plus about half of Cracking the Coding Interview). Last month I received two FAANG offers.. accepted one for 250k compensation plus 20k signon.

10/10, would recommend, doubled my income, wish I would have done this 2 years into my career instead of 5. BTW, I was not accepted for some super-senior position at all... Just one notch above new grad hires."
"892","Thanks for sharing this.. it helps."
"893","Let's talk a bit about the meaning of the word 'experience'. I'm borrowing a line my wife used in teaching advanced motorcycling. Many of her students would frequently report, ""I've been riding for 15 years"". When the riding part of the course, taught on a closed racetrack, would begin, of course the ""15 years experience"" riders were doing the worst. The line she would ask students to consider during the classroom prep for the track was, ""Do you have 15 years of experience, or do you have 1 year of experience repeated 15 times?""

Someone's who's just been riding on Sunday down to the coffee shop isn't learning new skills or improving existing ones because they are not challenging themselves.

Taking the bot mot over to software development -- I'd expect after 7 years you should already have figured out the common data structures, out of necessity and exposure in code written by others. 

There are going to be gaps, however, things like rarely used structures or algos that aren't obvious derivatives of other ideas. Even if you never use one directly, often you can find yourself adapting facets of the knowledge to other problems.

You don't have to enroll in a course to learn. There are popular comp-sci books that either have hundreds of ""recipes"" in them, or professional papers like ACM proceedings, and many technology companies have corporate subscriptions that grant unlimited access to their catalogs. Maybe spend two 30-minute sessions per week over coffee or tea or whatever your stimulant of choice browsing. You don't need 100% comprehension, just file away the knowledge that such-and-such exists and you know where to find it if you need it.

Written by a 35-years experience senior engineer, self-educated. (Maybe 20 years of actually doing new stuff in different types of software)."
"894","You cannot work as a software developer without using Data Structures or Algorithms. Since youve been using them the whole time, perhaps all you need is the terminology."
"895","It's better that you pick the topic that you're more likely to stick to. Make it a secondary goal that you actually enjoy yourself, because if one topic ends up being a total grind then you will quit. 

With exercise, the 'best' exercise is the one you like enough to stick with. Likewise, I think best topics for self-study are the ones you find to be most interesting.

Try a little of both, and whichever one you enjoy more--stick with that one."
"896","Sounds reasonable. Thank you."
"897","Yes its definitely worth learning some of the basics"
"898","I'm not sure where you live, but in my state, .Net developers are in high demand and their pay is above average. Most companies here don't do the LC style interviews, they're more interested in your relevant experience, and side projects/open source contributions if they're pretentious. The cost of living in my state is also fairly low."
"899","I am doing okay with .net for now. But the idea is to do much better. (Better than most companiy)"
"900","I understand. I'm kind of in the same boat, except with 6 yoe. I would recommend giving some deep thought on your goals and what it is you actually want to achieve. 

Personally, I want to be in a position where I have most of my expenses paid off and I can work a comfortable job doing something I enjoy, like teaching or making art.

Since I make decent money at my current position and my cost of living is very moderate, I could achieve that goal within 7 years or less. But I hate where I live and I want to relocate some place nicer. So if I make some sacrifices, I can probably relocate and get a higher paying job, but ultimately sacrifice my long term goal and put it off an additional 6 years minimum.

What are you after? If it's money &amp; quality of life, you can get more money by moving somewhere like Texas, get a 6 bedroom house for under $200k and a sweet gig that pays you close to 6 figs to pay off that house in no time. But if you dont like Texas, or you're after a status boost, that's another story :P

Anyway, best of luck to you! Feel free to reach out, I don't find many industry experienced people who are looking to study algos &amp; ds with me."
"901","I've noticed the same thing in my area. A lot of jobs looking for a combo of C#/.NET and some JS framework."
"902","This is SUPER me right now...like, WTF can I offer the top tech firms? Im just a AWS/cloud/node/react/security/terraform/DevOps/networking/IT generalist...I dont know my graphs from my tries, but, I have shipped code used at F100 companies and worked on 30m dollar projects...k8s at scale? Not like google, but Ive dabbled...they wont hire me if I cant balance a binary tree or do graph traversal off the top of my head..."
"903","Well, I literally failed my Amazon interview because I couldnt write DFS search on a Graph fast enough and I didnt know how to heapify a min-heap.

And yeah, I was working on a 70Mn project when I was interviewing for them. It doesnt matter at all."
"904","Well they have to come up with interviews that are fair to people from smaller companies. More money doesnt mean better."
"905","I think they value how fast you can solve a problem more because that is something that can be measured in a limited interview time frame. It's not like they will ask us to spend a couple of weeks and if they like us we are hired."
"906","If you want to get a job at Google... yes. This is because the notorious Google interviews are heavy on Datastructures.

But please note that studying Datastructures and algorithms on websites such as leetcode, some people find it extremely sole crushing and demotivating. It might not be worth degrading your passion for programming.

So please take these 2 points into account."
"907","I agree that its really demotivating preparing for those interviews, especially when youre already doing well in your job. You know enough data structures and algorithms that is needed for you to do your job.
This is a really terrible way to judge a candidates skill IMO."
"908","Good, I'm not the only one."
"909","600+ upvotes and no answer. You really shook the waters here."
"910","To preface this - I've got about a decade of experience, and I spent about eight years of that writing .NET applications of varying size/complexity. I also have a CS degree, albeit a long time ago.

While having an in-depth knowledge of DSA is useful in your day-to-day job as a developer, I truly believe that you can go through your entire career not knowing anything about **standard** DSA.

The reason I say standard is because whether you know it or not, you're already using many of the standard structures, but are using them within the .NET standard library. You're already aware of dictionaries, lists, linked lists, hash sets, the different sorting algorithms at play within the framework. You've probably also run into code where someone is using multiple foreach loops to go through a nested collection to find something, and have had to rewrite that code to be more efficient.

I recently decided to jump on the DSA/LC bandwagon, because I felt that I didn't know as much as I needed, but to be honest you're probably not as far off as you think you are. It's always worth learning how your chosen language/framework deals with things like sorting - for example when it chooses to use merge sort or when it chooses to use quicksort, but ultimately that's what you'll be learning. You'll be refreshing your knowledge in a different context.

As for getting a job at Google, while I don't work for a big tech company, one thing I will say is that they clearly value people with experience in multiple languages. During my eight years writing .NET code, I didn't get a peep from any Big N recruiters, but the second I threw Ruby and PHP on my CV I had recruiters from Amazon and Facebook contacting me regarding roles. The point I'm trying to get across is that it's not necessarily a skill thing - it's how you sell yourself."
"911","What would you do if you have to get a much higher paying job than the one you have right now?"
"912","Is contracting an option for you? It's all dependent on stack/location, but in some areas contractors can make a tidy sum."
"913","IMO Contracting is not that stable.I need a steady income."
"914","I went over 20 years and never did...  Now I do.  Really depends on if you're going to be in the job market or not.

I'm guessing the big thing now is to switch jobs more often, so it's probably best to do them once in a while so you're not 100% rusty on them.

The thing is that if you don't use them, you'll get a bit rusty later, but the memory will come back with some refresh."
"915","What is your tech stack? And what kind of softwares do you make?"
"916","What I do now is all mobile from enterprise software to regular mobile apps.  I haven't put any apps out yet.

I use Apple's iOS, Objective-C and Swift.

Part of the goal is to build specialized business software that works on iPhones.  So far, the only back end work is with the pre-packaged setups like Realm/Firebase and some custom NodeJS.

My background is in custom business software that would run on a client server setup like a MS SQL server, now I'm moving those apps over to a mobile platform.

Another part of the goal is regular over the counter mobile apps."
"917","IMO DS&amp;A skills become less and less important as technology gets cheaper and more powerful...  
And if you're perfectly happy making .net applications you will probably never need to know this stuff.  


However there are jobs out there that probably pay better that require some serious number crunching. Those jobs are probably going to require knowledge in that area.  


So I guess at the end of the day it's about where you want to go in your career.  


Personally I suck at math and hate working too deeply in it. I have numeric dyslexia so it's easy for me to make small mistakes in math and algorithms. So I know I won't be happy in those positions. even with the higher pay. But it's up to you."
"918","Well as long as you are content, nothing else matters."
"919","&gt;IMO DS&amp;A skills become less and less important as technology gets cheaper and more powerful...

This is completely true.

If someone throws up an MR where they've implemented their own sort to sort an array of Strings, I am going to kick it back to them and tell them to use the language's \`.sort\` method.

There are still cases where DS&amp;A are important - performing operations on huge data sets comes to mind; but even then, there are usually libraries with implementations of every algorithm you might need, and DS&amp;A knowledge becomes more about understanding when to use which tool, rather than knowing how to build each tool themselves."
"920","As someone that has also spent most of their career in the .Net ecosystem. Focus your time and attention on being a better developer instead of being so focused in one tech stack.  Google and StackOverflow exist to help with syntax of how to do something. The bigger issue is knowing how to best make something possible."
"921","So what does 'rising up' mean to you? I get the sense you think its not possible without doing leetcode somehow? Does it mean working for a FANG company? Making more money? I can tell you that you can make a ton of money never doing leetcode type interview questions."
"922","Making money. But at the same time, sticking to coding. I do not want to become a manager."
"923","Keep in mind that yes, the FANG companies offer higher salaries. But they are also in high COL areas. No reason, if you are good, that you can't make $140k+ in a medium COL area after 4+ years, possibly even more (I'm sure there are examples here that could chime in) without doing leetcode."
"924","It depends which direction you want to take your career in - and it sounds like you do have that choice. I work heavily in simulations so for me personally I find algorithms to be one of those things where it can make you a better developer in certain scenarios, but you can't use them if you don't know about them in the first place.

For instance, if I am faced with a new problem, I might think about it differently if I have a solid, prior understanding of algorithm X or Y. Otherwise, ignorance is somewhat bliss - but the final product might not be as optimal.

Again, I'd say it really depends on what you want to focus your career on. You certainly don't need A&amp;DS for everything"
"925","&gt; ay it really depends on what you want to focus your career on. You certainly don't need A&amp;DS for

I have a question. And I need you to answer it honestly. 
Do you think someone can get better at solving algos? 
I mean I do understand that if you have a fair understanding of certain topics then it becomes easier. But after that, do you get better? Some people are naturally very good at it. Others not so much. I say this because there was this algorithm that took me an hour to solve. While my friend solved it within 20 minutes. I have never been in the habit of solving puzzles. So I have zero practice. He has been doing it off and on for 2 years. But I doubt if it has to do with that. I think he is just relatively smarter than me in that regard."
"926","&gt; I say this because there was this algorithm that took me an hour to solve. 

As long as you are making progress, you are progressing. Do we get better? If we stick at it, yes. I wouldn't directly compare against your friend about ""time to understanding"". Some people take longer to grasp something *but once they know it, they know it very well*.  
Like many things in software, we learn best by doing. Find code that utilizes some algorithm to produce a thing. Be it bucket sort, breadth-first search, recursion vs iteration, or whatever the algorithmic flavor of the day is. I'd implement it myself, see where I struggle and just try to grasp the theory together with the implementation details. After that you might spot patterns in places where it might be applicable, and the fun begins..."
"927","&gt;Some people take longer to grasp something but once they know it, they know it very well.

The people who learn things more quickly are usually the people who have an easier time recalling/relearning them, too. There is no tradeoff here."
"928","I will take your advice. Thank you =
"
"929","It's practice mate. Think of all the people in the world who are excellent at what they do, and now think of how many of them got there without thousands of hours of hard work and failures. Anybody who is *sufficiently motivated* is capable of learning interview-scope DS&amp;A."
"930","I agree. There is no substitute to practice. It was just that I wanted to be sure I practice the right stuff. There os an ocean out there. You can't learn it all. You will have to focus on one section."
"931","I wrote bubble-sort algorithm within a month of learning to program without realizing I had written it until after the fact. This was in February. I started in January. 

I had been grinding those coding websites for 2 - 3 hours before I came across the problem where I accidentally wrote the algorithm. I started off not even knowing how to approach a problem  this looks like a previous problem. Its all pattern recognition and you develop a bag of tricks for problems.

I havent even started learning DS &amp; Algos yet (starting in April). Take this from somebody who used to think getting better at that stuff was impossible, you can become better. Just practice."
"932","I'm the same. I'm actually older than you and currently doing leetcode in my spare time (certainly not grinding though, don't understand how that would be helpful).

Best of luck!"
"933","Thanks. And best of luck  to you too."
"934","Sounds like me, haha. Although, I plan on going a different route--self employment"
"935","I already tried, doesnt work. It requires talking to people ="
"936","Do you mind sharing your current salary range? I'm curious as to where your data point stands in the great debate about the importance of theoretical understanding and career progression."
"937","I am a 9+ years experience Full stack engineer. I have worked on almost the full spectrum of platforms and languages (Games, Android, iOS, Windows Phone, BB, Node.js, Go, .Net, Python, Unity3D, Jenkins, AWS, GCP,  Kubernetes, Angular, React and many more). I was told that my resume is pretty impressive. Due to that I got called into interviews by Google (twice) and Amazon (thrice) both in 4 different countries for their on-site rounds. 
Despite all of this, I cant clear any of the on-site rounds, because I have never studied those Algorithms and Data Structures. I am a MBA in Finance, I was never taught any of that and none of my employers ever mind my lack of knowledge about those, because I am quite good at my job.
This time its Facebook, I am giving my last try there next week and trying to focus more on these interview problems which most probably Ill never need in my job. Its a waste of time, effort and energy for me, and honestly I am pretty happy with my current job. Its just that I dont want to miss the opportunity to see how these companies work with the unimaginable scale. How is it that they dont break things often and many other things to quench my curiosity.

If I could suggest you anything, itd be that its not really required to be in FAAAM to be successful in Software engineering, unless you have curiosity like me or if youre after the money they will pay.
Whatever is your reason, its not impossible for people like us to get there. It just requires some efforts. Ive started doing that for last couple of years and its still a long way to go for me (they add those system design interviews for senior positions which are much harder to crack, even if you have designed such systems).

If you think its worth it, you should give it a try. Its not hard to get an interview there. If you are good, theyll notice you sooner or later, but start preparing from now, otherwise youll have to get rejections for few times."
"938","With 7 years, I'd say you are probably good in terms of using the various technologies. If you do want go to for it, definitely study the data structures and algorithms! With just a bit of grinding and your experience, I'd say you've got this in the bag!"
"939","Go ml.net hardcore. Using two models in production and it works great. Can't recommend it enough"
"940","Always be learning.  It's as simple as that.

If you don't, one day you will wake up without the ability to get a job as a software engineer.  You'll probably blame it on your age, but really it's because tech moved on and you didn't move on with it.

If you're ambitious and like a bit of fun, I recommend [SICP](https://github.com/sarabander/sicp).  It's MIT's old CS101 class, and it's legendary.  The lectures on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J_xL4IGhJA&amp;list=PLE18841CABEA24090) are fantastic too, but you'll want to turn on CC for the few places the tapes have warped.

SICP set MIT on the map, and anyone who has taken it will still recommend it today.  The first chapter in the book has tree structures and recursion in it.  It's a bit ambitious, but it will push you into the deeper parts of data structures in one week, instead of one semester."
"941","Also with 7 years of exp youre no longer entry level at google. Which means there will be a big design component in your interview"
"942","I think at your point having project management experience, development and deployment knowledge and awareness of development principles as well as the patterns are more important that leetcode."
"943","Yes . Never stop learning.   

My advice is to go into the C deep end.  C underpins almost everything.   Manual memory allocation will also drive home the importance of data structures.

C#, .NET, angular ... that's all a distraction from the good stuff.


Perhaps your brain isn't wired for this stuff.  But you need to realize that it isn't out of your reach.  Do it already"
"944","Dive into C? You are practically asking me to dive into a Sea. Lol.  Hiw about C++ ?"
"945","C++ is C with a mountain more stuff.

C has very few parts to it.  But it can make things more verbose, long winded.

C also will be quicker at resetting your views on memory (important) since C++ continues with the idea of objects.

C is one of those languages where once you understand it,  you can do anything.  Yes it might seem like a huge sea,  but once you learn to swim, you'll wonder what all the fuss was about."
"946","Piquied my curiosity. I am searching C on udemy right now."
"947","I built out a project in C. My understanding of how memory works increased drastically after doing so. Everything is in manual in C."
"948","I think I know what to buy next on udemy"
"949","Just bought it"
"950","Nice. Lots of aha moments ahead.   I'm very glad I stuck with it.  IMO, no better way to learn than writing code and failing :).

IMO the coolest part is seeing that all these variables and objects in your program are just numbers sitting at a memory address. Variables and structures are just memory offsets into that memory that the compiler sets up for you.  ""There is no ~~spoon~~ variable ...""  hehe"
"951","I wouldn't dive into C unless I want to work in IoT. I would recommend C++ as you still need to understand the underlying x86\_64 architecture and memory management. But C++11 is still being used in high-performance backend applications today so it has some applicability."
"952","   I really do think there is value is learning C before moving to C++.  IMO c++ hides important memory concepts/lessons.  I'm not suggesting he then uses C for everything."
"953","&gt; My advice is to go into the C deep end.  C underpins almost everything.   Manual memory allocation will also drive home the importance of data structures.

If this aint gatekeeping I dont know what is."
"954","You moron, you cropped out my last 2 sentences.

If this aint trolling I dont know what is."
"955","I am pretty sure you have never written a production software in C. Youre in for a surprise."
"956","C/C++ is my day job, buddy ;)"
"957","Have you tried instead of him watching you work through an issue, you watch him work it through? My boss did that with me to help me learn and it helped A TON. He sat there and watched, and when it was clear I was stuck, he'd pose a question that would nudge me in the right direction without telling me how to do it. Things like ""Okay, what do we know? Don't know? How do we find out?"" and the like. I hope this made sense, and I hope you guys get past this!"
"958","Most definitely agree with this. Would also add to watch HOW he solves problems if he even gets to that point in the first. You need to know what his deficiency is before trying to apply corrective measures. Might not even be a problem with his critical thinking and more a confidence issue where he panics when something breaks.

TL;DR Be observant as well when you're coaching him with the other suggested method and note patterns you pick up."
"959","This is because questions are more important than answers to the skill of critical thinking."
"960","Thank you, this is some good perspective I needed to hear. I think I've let the pressure of deadlines get to me too much in these conversations. But he's going to be far more productive (and happy) down the line if I take my time with him now, instead of thinking I can quickly fix this one issue and he'll somehow figure it out next time."
"961","Along the lines of what he's saying, I don't know if your company does pairing but you should bring it up. Paired programming why my principal devs skyrocketing my ability and knowledge, both while driving and navigating."
"962","Create runbooks and have him write shit down. There's a chance that he's just overwhelmed with the system and when something breaks will just start panicking, flailing wildly and nothing works.

Start asking ""what have you tried so far"", then pointing him the right direction or at the correct runbook then letting him work for 20-30 minutes before checking on him.

If he's still straight up incapable after all of that, that's a problem and bob may have to find a new job."
"963","Thank you, this is great advice. I think both the idea of physically writing out some runbook procedures, and asking him to lead the debugging conversation, will both really help here."
"964","You have to let him struggle. At then end of the day if you want him to anything more than copy pasta code monkey you need him to struggle, and you need to recognize he's going to take way way longer than you and other's to get really anything done.

I ween interns and new grads off me pretty fast from code and environment specific questions. I set the boundary that you only talk to me when you don't understand either an architecture issue i.e how service A talks to B, or 2. You can make literally 0 progress on your issue, you've tried everything and given up. On 2. I always ask what they tried and if I think they could try other ways I suggest that. If that still fails then comes the good part. I love helping people out so I like this part, now I do what others have said pair program through a problem, I show them how I use a debugger, read documentation, search online, explore tools to understand the problem better.

At the end we solve the problem together I rubber duck off them to explain my thought process and let them disagree with me, many times their wrong but sometimes they're right, and it's awesome when they are but that's not the point I want them to see how I think and I want to see how they think so I can show them themselves where they might have flaws in their assumptions, many times I add leading questions so they can figure out the problem themself rather than me finding it for them.

Alot of times especially with those who got good grades they're really scared to be wrong and the majority of the time I'm just there teaching them that that's we do all day make mistakes till we figure out the problem. Other times its they need to up their critical thinking skills which the pair programming solves, other times they just need to learn how to be self sufficient and figure out how to use all the tools at their disposal to successfully do their job which is why I let them struggle.

Overall though be kind and nice, don't ever be dismissive, if for any reason you make some scared to fail, take risks, or ask questions thats when the real issues start occurring and that can be hard to break."
"965","Your approach sounds like the one my research advisor takes. Good leadership like that is how you build an excellent team from first principles. Give someone some code, you help them for a day. Teach them how to generate the process themselves, and you set them up for a lifetime of success."
"966","A lot of good insight here, thank you. Especially about people who did well in school being afraid to fail in the field -- That describes Bob pretty well. It's been a minute since I was in school, so I forget that the finality of *turning something in* can make people really commit-shy once they get into a job."
"967","It's possible he's scared to mess up. To the point where he doesn't want to try when the issue is outside his immediate knowledge base.

Some of the other suggestions here seem good too. I would try and let him figure it out himself sometimes (assuming the problem isn't very urgent). Or just nudge him in the right direction without outright doing it for him. Let him know that it's okay to interrupt you if he gets stuck."
"968","I think you're enabling him. If he learned how to code he can figure how to troubleshoot problems. I mean if you're given a regular compiler and a magical compiler that fixes syntax/logical errors which one would you choose? You're his magical compiler."
"969","I think you're exactly right. I'm going to take the time I was spending on fixing his issues, and have him lead debugging sessions instead. The chips can fall where they may -- If he gets behind, that's something our team will have to work out."
"970","This is a long shot, but he may not develop those skills, or if he does it won't go as far as you want.

That's my opinion from being on the opposite end. I've developed in a way where I'm too self-sufficient and independent, so I ask for help too late. I'll carry 10 grocery bags at once and open the door while I'm carrying them, even if someone is there, just for the self-sufficiency challenge. A downside is that I haven't built the types of relationships which other people have.

It might be good to see his behavior as not matching what you need at the moment, but for having advantages down the road. Maybe he'll be better at interpersonal skills in the office. Plus, even if he lacks some critical thinking, he could certainly be expected to remember solutions you've already provided. So if you help him with something once he shouldn't have to ask the same question again. That is a reasonable expectation."
"971","Great perspective here, thank you. Hadn't really considered the flip-side you bring up."
"972","You need to give him open ended help. I'm in a junior position and when I ask my lead dev for help he tells me stuff like ""Try searching for x"", ""You might be able to query for that"" or sometimes more pointed if it's something more difficult like ""Maybe start with looking in the FormBuilder class"".

He will help me more if I go for awhile without making any progress but I'm expected to try to work through problems on my own and I've learned everything I know about the system this way and have become pretty competent over time.

Do not just do things for him. He'll gain nothing from it. If it's time critical walk him through it but make sure he is the one doing it."
"973","Thank you, great to hear this perspective. I think I've let Management's (unrealistic) expectations dictate the pace of his output, which has of course become partly my output. But the only way way to get him to produce at the level they expect is to try and lower that bar for now, so he has time to learn and grow into the role."
"974","Don't tell him what to do. Don't show him what to do.

Tell, and show him, what happens in your brain that allows you to figure out what to do. Setting a break point is easy, most people know how to do that. But how do you know *when* and *where* to set that breakpoint? Everyone knows how to read a log file, but when do you go into the logs versus set a breakpoint? Do you do both? Why? How do you find what you're looking for in a log file? What are you even looking for?

When you see a problem do you instantly know how to fix it? No, something happens in your brain that says ""Hmm... I should place a break point here, here, and here, and see what happens"". What was that thing that happened to get you there? That's what he doesn't know, that's what he needs to be taught.

So next time he needs help, get up, walk over to his computer, and talk to him as you steer his brain towards arriving at the same conclusions you arrived at. Once he knows the pattern of arriving at conclusions, that pattern can be extended to any problem.

A good first question is: ""Ok, what's the problem?""

If he can explain the problem, you can move on. If he can't, now you help him figure out *what* the problem is, and *why* it's a problem.

The next obvious follow up is ""What have you already tried to fix it?""

If he's on the right track, nudge him in that direction. If he's not, you can try to figure out his reasoning for trying those things, maybe he had the right idea but the wrong approach. Guide him down the right path, but you need to make sure he is theone that actually discovers the path."
"975","Wow. This is a truly generalizable solution."
"976","Great advice, thank you. I will definitely be following your model here."
"977","Make sure he writes every session down.
And have him drive the debug. Itll be slow at first but after a few months he should leave you alone."
"978","Had the same thing happen to me at work. A co-worker used to ping me whenever he got stuck. Most of the time, he could have easily found a solution / asked a question on StackOverflow instead of pinging me. After a month or two, the co-worker was fired because the project manager was fed up with the guy's poor performance, missed deadlines, and undelivered promises. I helped as much as I could, but I also took the burden of doing somebody else's work, which eventually reflected on my performance. 

If I were you, I'd be honest with him. Tell him that you're not responsible for doing his work. Of course, it's alright to ask questions and collaborate, but if he pings you with ""Something broke! Help,"" it doesn't sound like he's put any effort into solving the problem and simply hopes to take advantage of you because you've been on the team longer and supposedly know everything about the project. Let him work on his own. Tell him that you're busy and will not be able to help with that. After a few hours, reach out to him and ask how it's going."
"979","Thanks for the perspective. This is where I've started to go -- *I'm in a meeting; I'll take a look in an hour or so if it's still an issue*. That sort of thing. So far though, it's still an issue 100% of the time when I check back in with him.

But then again as others have pointed out, I haven't been helping him help himself. We're in a similar situation to the one you described, constant impending deadlines and shifting requirements. That's life as a developer. And as the senior dev on my team, I'm feeling the weight of responsibility for delivering everything we've been tasked with. But it's also my responsibility to speak up when the expectations from upstairs are unrealistic, especially for a new hire."
"980","&gt;I've probably made this situation worse by doing things for him a couple times

You have to stop helping him so much. You also should communicate to him that the amount of time you spend helping him is starting to hurt your own productivity--he might not even know that this is an issue and just think the fastest way to get an answer is to ping you. Having questions is normal, but it is also something that he can work on limiting.

When he does ask a question, try to do less. It is actually a lot harder than just doing it for him, but coming up with a reasonable hint and then leaving him to figure it out is the only way he will ever improve. 

If your team really runs out of time you can go back and do his work for him later, but don't keep taking on his work until it really comes to that and your manager assigns you that task."
"981","do you feel like he has enough understanding of the code base, relationship models, all the neat extra magic the framework/s may have and how they work? Sometimes that may help him better wield his technical knowledge and problems solving skill,  once he better understands the context"
"982","This is a great point I hadn't considered. I will definitely take some time to walk through the foundation architecture with him some more. I think you may be onto something here."
"983","I hope it helps.

I'm new to a code base and also to the field, and there are 3 things:

1) I have to level up technology-wise - so many libraries, packages, and parts of a framework I haven't used yet. The code base is huge, and some things are done in some complex/savvy ways that make it all work. Almost everything I've been asked to do, I've never done before.  I appreciate that, I can learn, but it isn't easy.  It starts to get easier a bit in general.

2)   The relationships and the particular service being provide is a bit of a web itself, outside of the code itself.  I need to understand better what it is we are actually trying to do, the business. 

3) Sometimes problems and fixes just aren't explained that well.  One task I have, I have verbal instructions, a note in this or that IM, something in a spreadsheet, so on top of points 1 and 2, I have to put that all together.  Tickets need to be organized. Basically, I have to be sure I understand what is actually being asked.  Sometimes that isn't always clear, what exactly am I being asked to build.  Point 2 will also probably help this point 3 as well."
"984","[deleted]"
"985","I'll be applying for my first ones soon. How're you getting on with it in general? How much knowledge did you have before? Are you fitting in well?"
"986","You need to wean him from your help. Ask him what he tried before coming to you. If he says nothing then ask him what do you think you should try? What did you try last time? Etc. Be blunt about ""I need you to try X number of things/x amount of time before you come back to me for more ideas if you're still stuck"".

Be clear you don't want him to spend weeks spinning his wheels on a single problem without help, but at the same time he needs to start developing more independence and troubleshooting skills to start tackling some of these things themselves"
"987","I am not a developer as of yet, I'm still in the learning stages, however, i have been the Technical Support Manager for the past 8 years for my current employer, that being said, there is a right way to troubleshoot and there is a wrong way, everything i do is very granular. I have a process and no matter who i hire in, i always give them this process so they can follow it. After about a month or so, they have made it their own. In the beginning i have to step in because they are new but after a while, it's rare for me to have to take over. Share your process with him, have him go down the list. He doesn't have a process of his own, he's too new. If after his 90 days he or she has not grown technically, I release them but thats usually not the case. I think it's everyone's responsibility to train new hires. Maybe you could ask someone else on your team to help out as well so you can balance the time spent with him."
"988","Sometimes its not critical thinking but a lack of business or architecture knowledge that might let bob piece together the underlying problems they need to target.

It may also be a lack of awareness of certain tools at their disposal especially if said tools may be proprietary. 

We can probably assume that what ever is challenging bobs ability to perform is additionally magnified by his own insecurity (not wanting to blow anything up, not wanting to look stupid, among other things)

I dont want to assume since i know nothing about your team or the work you do, but I would say assessing where his deficiencies are based on your own current knowledge and what someone typically would need to know to understand where to start poking around and why is the first step to addressing the underlying challenges bob is presenting. 

From my own experience I typically find lack of knowledge for the business/product and lack of architecture knowledge to be the common pain points and not the critical thinking part."
"989","A couple people have mentioned this, and I think it's right on. I probably glossed over some of the base architecture stuff, or else it happened so early in Bob's employment that he had no context for it and could gain a lot more from that talk now."
"990","Best of luck m8. I hope it all works out!"
"991","I don't. I hire people with established critical thinking skills because it's way easier :) I establish those critical thinking skills by asking some interview questions. Sometimes I get it wrong, but most of the time I don't. 

&gt; I've tried working through an issue myself with Bob looking on, showing how I use breakpoints, logs, etc. 

We'll generally have to walk our greener engineers through stuff like this that you just don't learn in college.

There's a fine balance between ""beating your head into a wall until it gives"" and ""asking the senior for an hour to avoid wall-head-beating"". Most of the engineers I've worked with are able to find that balance within their respective team. I find I actively have to encourage new people to ask for time from the seniors more often than not, because everyone is ""very important and busy all the time"" in the minds of others. 

&gt; tl;dr - New guy knows how to code but can't solve problems. How do I help him learn how to think critically?

Stop responding. Let the timelines shift. Let the roadmaps get off-track. You're asserting the status quo isn't maintainable, so somethings gotta give. Bob will sink or swim.

And if your management culture doesn't support that, then you need to fire Bob and bring someone else in."
"992","You're looking at this as though op is a manager.  Nowhere in his post did he write that he hired bob."
"993","They're also making it seem as if their hiring strategy is perfect and never slips a problem-solving-deficient candidate through the cracks."
"994","He did say ""Sometimes I get it wrong"", so he is admitting his strategy isn't bulletproof."
"995","You're right; I didn't hire him. I'm just the senior dev on his team. I did, however, participate in the interview process, and I recommended we hire him. Along with everyone else. He interviewed brilliantly, blew it out of the water. But I do think, like /u/healydorf intimated, that our interview process needs some work. There's too much *Can you program* and not enough *Can you think like a programmer*."
"996","Well than this is something you can learn from then. Possibly add a part in the interview process where you give faulty code and they have to figure out what's wrong with it? I'm not sure what the best way to approach this issue is tbh but it's good that you recognized that a mistake happened, which allows you to now go about fixing it."
"997","Tell him to study real analysis"
"998","Sorry to be harsh but:

&gt; New guy knows how to code but can't solve problems.

Solving problems *is what we do*. Code is just the end-product most of the times of us solving problems. If after all the effort you put in he's not picking up at this, it means he does not actually understand what he's doing. If he needs to be spoon-fed everything he's not a developer you want on your team. It means he does not actually understand what he's doing, he's just copy-pasting stuff / following what others do in the hope it works."
"999","I usually just tell them to do things like add some breakpoints and look at what X/Y/Z values are and if they agree what their expectations.  If the ask how do I set breakpoints, they I will say read go read about the tool gdb.

Basically I give them a task with direction within the debugging realm and walk away.  If they don't catch on over  a few months then I talk with our manager and comment how Bob isn't really working out because A/B/C."
"1000","Tell him to read [Seven Tips for a Junior Developer](http://www.pearlleff.com/seven-tips-for-a-junior-developer)."
"1001","Great post, thank you. I will definitely pass this along."
"1002","How can someone have good coding skills but no critical thinking skills? Dont the two go hand in hand"
"1003","You would think so. As others have pointed out though, it may be that what I'm interpreting as a lack of critical thinking is actually just a lack of confidence, a fear of breaking something, or just a lack of knowledge of how the base architecture fits together. The first two are culture/personality fit issues, but the last especially is something I can work on with him on Monday."
"1004","How do you recognize that his coding skills are good? Is his code readable, efficient or just solves the problem?"
"1005","You don't. People who have critical thinking skills but with lesser coding skills will improve fast, but it's hard to acquire critical thinking skills if you don't have any - nevermind how good you might be at coding. Should've considered testing that during the interview."
"1006","Yep, this has come up a few times in this thread. We definitely need to take a look at our interview process. I'm not a manager and don't ultimately make the call of who gets hired or fired, but I can definitely steer my portion of interviews more toward testing critical thinking skills."
"1007","I think if developers are not involved in the hiring process I would start there. Because it really sounds like this guy should've been caught in the process.

I set up an interview process for a client of mine where we basically did a pair-programming session. Happy to explain the process if you're interested."
"1008","i do; you watch

"1009","make bob sit at the computer and type and use the breakpoints. Don't tell him everything. Ask him what he thinks. Tell him he is expected to start figuring this out. You are here to help. Tell him to take notes. Since everything is new he should write stuff down. 

That is fair. If he still does not progress after some time, he won't make it. However, you need to give him time."
"1010","It's a challenge. Critical thinking is reflective of IQ and virtually impossible to change."
"1011","It is not at all clear at this point if he's not troubleshooting his own issues because of behavioral conditioning/bad habits etc, or if he actually doesn't possess the ability for critical thinking. 

Attempt to address the behavior with guidence with coaching and then later assess if it if he has the intellectual horsepower or not"
"1012","[deleted]"
"1013","I don't get why this is being downvoted."
"1014","Because there's a lot of anxious kids here who don't like what you're saying.

Because this is exactly what is going to happen at most companies. If you can't understand what you're doing well enough to be able to debug the stuff you *wrote yourself* you are going to be *fired*. Companies don't pay you to write exactly what others tell you to write, and then let them fix the issues you created."

This sub is dominated by these folks. People who grind leet code. People who make it their life mission to get into Google or Facebook because they feel working elsewhere has no point."
"1018","I can understand why some people chase this, as an F myself.

There is a standard of living afforded by most tech jobs.  And then theres F and G.

Its not unheard of (and very very likely) that by the time youre a principal (L6 at F and G) you can easily be making well over 400k and in some cases way over half a mil TC.  Not to mention literally everything else is covered for you (food, transport, many expenses others have to pay for).

Sure, not everyone is cut out for these jobs and not everyone needs to get a job here to be successful.  But, going from a well known tech company at my last job that already paid damn well to F resulted in an absolutely unbelievably absurd change in my standard of living.  Just my two cents."
"1019","Sure, but quality of life is about a lot more than total compensation from your job. I work at a Big Name and make a lot of money, but as soon as I have free time to get my resume and everything together im leaving asap, and willing to take a pay cut to do it because I kinda hate it. The point of the question and the above response are not whether it can be worth it to grind to get one of these jobs, it's whether it's normal not to do that, which it totally is. As somebody who has done it I'd say it's probably not gonna be the right thing for a lot of people, even if they're totally capable of it, and plenty of people I know who work less and make less money are much more happy with their lives."
"1020","What specifically is disagreeable about a big-name? Culture? The projects? I wish I were in your position right now, being more comfortable in life and knowing how to program. I am in humanities and I am seeking a career change at 31 years old. Its going to require a lot of diligence."
"1021","Mileage will vary quite a lot I'm sure but I personally don't like most tech industry culture to begin with, and the big name I work at (and I'm certain it's not unusual in this regard) has a weird mythology going on. There's a huge difference between liking your job and loving the company you work for as a brand, and that's rampant. As far as projects go, in my case and that of plenty of people I know you work on a team with very specific responsibilities, siloed from other departments and paranoia about sharing too much about what you're working on when you do interact. In my case in particular my superiors are extremely aloof and in a different state, so things are a huge mess and basically I got dropped into leading a team unexpectedly. 

Like i said, mileage will vary on this stuff greatly, probably even within my own company, but I know plenty of developers who might be making a little less money than me but they're still making much more than I'm sure you're coming from--I was a philosophy major who switched over at 28, so I understand--but have more interesting work, with better leadership and cultures, so the main thrust is that it's not necessarily worth grinding specifically to work at one of these companies. It's just a fetish, and the prominence of that fetish is probably a big factor in making it such a weird mess in the first place."
"1022","&gt; principal (L6 at F and G)

Principal at Google is 8. There are probably 1/100 as many L8s as L6s."
"1023","And to add, L5 is a terminal level so you actually have to get yourself promoted above that, it doesn't just happen by virtue of staying long enough."
"1024","You don't get L5 just by staying long enough either. It's just that if you are sitting at L4 for years and years and years people might start looking at why you aren't growing. At L5 there are no longer growth expectations before people get a little concerned."
"1025","L6 can happen with an amortized moderate amount of effort by the time someone turns 45 Id say.

In any case, in the 20s and 30s pre-having a family perse, I can certainly see how some people would slog it out to put themselves at a position of very comfortable wealth later on."

But yeah, planning on making L8 at Google is a recipe for unhappiness. Most engineers never make L6."
"1032","yeah they cant make L6 because they don't have a masters probably. that was my point, at a certain level i don't think you can go any higher without an MS or even a Phd. a quick linkedin search shows there are people who worked there like 15 years and are at fellow level or distinguished engineer or principle and they don't have less than a masters. with most of them having a Phd."
"1033","&gt; yeah they cant make L6 because they don't have a masters probably

This is absolutely 100% completely wrong. I know L6s at Google who don't even have a BS. Education comes up literally not at all in promotion reviews. 

Googlers are disproportionately highly educated. That's what you are seeing here. People who are smart and driven enough to stand out among Google engineers tend to be the sort of people who were smart and driven enough to get lots of degrees.  But loads of L4 engineers have PhDs and have been sitting at L4 for 5+ years. There are plenty of jokes about how many PhDs are just pushing protos at Google. Education background is completely independent of career trajectory.

And yeah I'd expect L8s to have been at Google for a long time. Its enormously difficult to develop the sort of wide influence you need to achieve that level in a short time frame."
"1034","no it isn't lol. jeff dean wouldn't be the head of google brain with just a BA. link me to high level google engineers who only have a BA. I wanna see the linkedin profiles. because I all I can seem to find is Phd and MA"
"1035","You aren't listening to me. Yes, a large portion of L8s have lots of degrees. That's because *a large portion of Googlers have lots of degrees*. I don't see how somebody could think that a masters degree from a decade or more ago has anything to do with advancing to major leadership roles. Feel free to just not believe me I guess.

Listing the specific L7-L8s and directors I've worked with reveals my personal identity too well but you can just look for directors of engineering at Google and find plenty with just bachelors degrees.

"1038","I would have to stand 50/50 on your stance. 

You are right, some people live to get into the big jobs. 

I also agree that not everyone (and honestly, most) enjoy the work and turn it off when they clock out. I completely respect that.

However, some of us grind at work and on our free time because we truly enjoy it. It would drive me nuts to not work on my homelab 3-4 times a week after work.

For example,

I spent my last weekend building an AWX tower for my NAS (for Plex) and server rack so I could automate 99% of it.  

The weekend before that, I spent 12 hours trying to get Zabbix to run in a certain way. Getting it work is the rush of dopamine I really enjoy. 

For a few of us, it's not the job, money, or title. It's just our passion."
"1039","&gt; It would drive me nuts to not work on my homelab 3-4 times a week after work.

That is very different from what the OP was referring to I feel. I too have a homelab, and I would go insane if I didn't get to dabble with personal projects. But, OP is going for, I think, people who's ""hobby"" is grinding away on leetcode. I am very confident that the people who dabble in homelabs doing it pretty much solely for working a better job compared to doing it for fun, is much less than the people on leet code doing the same."
"1040","Oh, I see what you mean. That's fair. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, agreed."
"1041","Side projects are always fun and are an easy resume ticket item. Leetcode questions are just about acing the technical interview, which is 5% of the real interview. The majority of the interview is about seeing if you can fit into the company's culture."
"1042","90% of my interviews are coding questions"
"1043","I think you are giving way too much credit to this sub!"
"1044","I don't think that grinding leetcode is necessarily true for everyone because for some it might true but for other its a hobby. I started coding not because I want to get a job in some big name companies but I just enjoy coding, leet code and other competitive programming websites are just places where I can practice and improve my problem solving skills. If someone doesn't enjoy problem solving I don't think they should work as a software engineer or any types of technical job. I don't know much about what they do in industry so I might also be wrong about my assumptions."
"1045","I think youre getting downvoted because you imply that not wanting to do challenges like Leetcode equates to not enjoying problem solving. When working as a professional software engineer, chances are you solve problems all day long that often have a real weight to them, at least for your career or your company. It can be rather hard to want to code more after already coding 50 hours a week, and especially so if its something isolated and random like a problem assigned by a website. Personally, I would never do Leetcode etc for fun, but I have worked on a passion project."
"1046","downvoting doesn't really mean much to me because I knew I was going to get downvote anyway. Doing something fun is subjective but you might be right about not wanted to do anything with after having to code for 50 hours a week. Also I don't think they just code all the time especially when you collaborate with other team members and designed your solution before implementing it."
"1047","&gt; Also I don't think they just code all the time especially when you collaborate with other team members and designed your solution before implementing it.

That's the most important part of coding. This is the difference in thinking between a senior engineer with years of experience and someone who hasn't entered the industry yet but grinds problem sets."
"1048","Yes, of course we dont write code all day long, but were still thinking about it! Sometimes I have so many other things going on at work that when I do get the chance to just program its a joy. But that doesnt mean I want to put my mind back into that mental space when I leave work most of the time, even if most of the day has been eaten up writing a design doc or discussing customer needs with project managers or whatever."
"1049","Well stated. I am on Job #4, almost 10 years into the industry. That's about a 2 year tenure average. I only ever ""leetcoded"" for about 4 weeks total in the past decade, closer to the start of my career than recently, but still not like 300+ problems a month or anything like that. That's completely unecessary, rote memory will help you memorize those keyboard shortcuts a bit better, but that's about it. If I worried the way this sub does then I would have been dead by age 30. Everyone's gotta chill out! We're all in this life thing together."
"1050","Username checks out"
"1051","This is really good advice"
"1052","Ive been going on 2 years minus my first 30 days looking for another offer. Seems like some jobs are so bad the mere presence of them on ones resume precludes them from escaping."
"1053","NOT TRUE MUST DO LEETCODE NOW GOOGLE CEO JUST OFFERED ME TO BE HIS POOL BOY FOR 300K TC"
"1054","Living life IS the goal. But, you DO need money to do that comfortably, particularly as you progress in life. Mortage, wife, kids, health care, savings, retirement/401k, getting a high salary earlier will make the later years of your life easier with the magic of compound interest.

Leetcode hell is real, unless you're in non-tech hubs, or working in non-tech products (where you'll get nearly half TC of a tech product, I know because I get this in an expensive tech hub). 

There's definitely a balance to it all, but the sub is pretty accurate in terms of finding work in target cities/companies, you're not going to skate around technical round interviews where the goal is literally to fail you unless you can do DS&amp;A."
"1055","Sturgeon's law applies as usual."
"1056","How do I buy gold? Although really ive been at this for years and haven't gotten to that entry level job yet :/"
"1057","Thanks so much, I need this right now."
"1058","Honestly after you have some years of experience and a couple side projects to show. You won't have to grind leetcode. 

This sub has gotten to the point that its FAANG/Big N or bust."
"1059","But grinding LeetCode, that should be done daily, regardless of who you are, or what you want."
"1060","/s"
"1061","This sub though you were serious, hilarious"
"1062","You think there arent people around here who say the same thing unironically, unamusing"
"1063","I think 90% of this sub doesn't know their arse from their elbow and are so engrossed in believing everything they read that they'd take obvious sarcasm and think the person was serious."
"1064","They dont know their elbow from their ass, so they come here looking for real answers, and somehow thats their fault? Thats not how that works...."

"1066","hehe dude my thought exactly? OP was specifically referring to the 'pressure' from this subreddit? Exactly my thought my vibe is most popular posts are from teenagers or early 20s. There is no pressure from this community man. there are plenty of posters who dont give a shit about grinding l33tcode or making big bucks working at a sleezy ad agency whose sole purpose is to collect all our data and sell it.

"1074","It only feels like 1.2 billion."
"1075","&gt;Why are you allowing a bunch of FAANG-obsessed Internet randos...

Once upon a time, the brightest minds launched startups. They had radical ideas and wanted to explore their potential. It takes guts striking out on your own with nothing to validate yourself but the confidence in your very own idea.

Maybe it's navigating healthcare in America, maybe it's that housing prices have skyrocketed with respect to inflation and wage growth. Whatever the reason is - people are afraid to strike out on their own and want some universally accepted indicator of success; getting into a FAANG seems to scratch that itch.

Personally, I want to end up at a startup - the sorta place where I can get hundreds of stock options, knowing if the company makes it, so do I. But this mentality isn't widely shared on this sub."
"1076","Im still in the job search but man was I close to an opportunity like this, in the end the startup decided to go with the other guy. Amazing product, great vision and the CEO already had a prior successful exit."
"1077","While I agree with your sentiments, do you actually think 30 years ago people were more entrepreneurial? People still wanted to work at the big companies at the time, from IBM to GE to banking to consulting or whatever. Startups were more unknown in 1990s than now. The only difference is that the general public now knows more about lucrative tech jobs so people who previously went to banking for the money are now attracted to FAANG."
"1078","You're kidding, right?  The history of the 1990s, 1980s and 1970s is _littered_ with startups."
"1079","I didn't say there were no startups, I said they were more unknown in 1990 than now."
"1080","&gt; Personally, I want to end up at a startup - the sorta place where I can get hundreds of stock options, knowing if the company makes it, so do I.

The problem here is that compensation at the major tech companies has grown so much that it is *unbelievably* difficult to match it even if your startup makes it. Exiting at 100M with 0.5% ownership is 500k. You'd make up that difference in a few years working at a major company. 

If you want ""if we make it I will end up with more money"" to work you need to be a founder."
"1081","&gt;I never opened Leetcode in my browser, never went to a meetup and I only code at work

Been doing this for about 8 years. I've also never done leet code, went to a meetup or code outside work.

It's called having a life. I'm married, have a newborn, house to take care of, gym five times a week and play sports three times a week. On top of all that, see friends a couple times a month and bust out the PS4..

Don't be scared of what you see here. It's mostly fresh grads that aspire to work at these massively popular companies and want $400k a year. If only they all realized at a young age, to make enough money to pay the bills and save a bit, and then make a life for themselves outside of work."

"1100","Thanks for the recommendation, Ill check it out!"
"1101","Oh wow, this is great, thank you!"
"1102","Just FYI, I ran some stats on experienceddevs, and while it appears at one point the forum was not too saturated with youngins, it's increasingly becoming dominated by CSCQ posters.

See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/eu3wt8/how_many_senior_developers_are_there_that_give/fflj6qo?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) and my related response to my post, which indicates that about 40% of commentators in EXPDEV are also CSCQ commentators.  Across all viewable reddit time (posts up to 1000) the stats are better, but more recent ones are seeing an influx of CSCQ posters."
"1103","While interesting, I'll argue that the reason for your stats are that most people learn about that sub from a reference in this sub."
"1104","That's the most likely cause, but the cause doesn't mitigate the effect.  40% of comments are from CSCQ commentators.  There's a case to be made that, in fact, this is a \*bad\* thing.    


What is the best case scenario here for people seeking advice?  The best case is that 40% of people in EXPDEV who have solid advice are also commenting in this sub forum.  The worst case is that 40% of people in EXPDEV are \*exactly\* the kind of people you don't want commenting in EXPDEV (inexperienced people).  


If people are going to EXPDEV because people are diverting CSCQ user attention to that forum, then that means EXPDEV is picking up lots of inexperienced people who are now giving advice there.  


The ideal scenario, if you're hoping to find quality advice here and in EXPDEV, would be people are directing EXPDEV users here, but instead the opposite is happening.  


There is a scenario I haven't cleaned the data up on, which would really clarify the issue if someone wants to do it, which is to not include users if they \*only\* made comments within their own posts to EXPDEV.  This way you could really understand whose giving advice."

"1109","One possible way to measure that is to chart the subscriber growth of this sub and that sub and see if theyre proportional."
"1110","Like the other poster said, I dont think that means much since most people are directed there from here.   Its a much harder analysis to make but it probably makes more sense to evaluate how posters evaluate their experience on the sub over time and if it goes up or down."
"1111","See my reply to that poster, I think the fact that we're funneling people over there is actually an important thing, not a less meaningful one.  It means it is quite possible this subreddit is lowering the quality of that reddit by constantly funneling people there.  


That \*may\* not be happening, but it's something to be wary of."
"1112","Right.  All Im saying is that before any sort of effect from a relationship can be hypothesized and investigated, the relationship first needs to be proven.  The relationship might even be positive since it keeps people discussing things that are more relevant to them.  Or it might be negative, I know we occasionally see accounts here saying theyre a college freshmen while also posting there that they have 10 years experience."
"1113","Ughhh no.  Dont tell people about that sub. It will be like the Eternal September. The fewer people who know about it the better."

"1115","Thank god. I've been looking for something like this."
"1116","Yea this sub is total trash"
"1117","FAANG doesnt automatically equal having no life. Sure you have to put in some hours to study and pass the interviews but once you are on the other side, its a pretty cushy life and great work life balance. Its an investment, not a death sentence to your work life balance.

That being said, despite what this sub seems to think, there are plenty of other good companies that pay well and have normal interviews, but of course those people dont really post online about it. They just get a job and live happily ever after."
"1118","Is the stuff mentioned by OP (going to meetups, grinding Leetcode, studying/coding outside of work) needed on the regular, for a dev to get into FAANG? I was under the impression that you just needed a decent amount of work experience, and a month or two of interview prep."
"1119","Going to meetups, coding outside of work is sort of a substitute for work experience. If you already have work experience, then yes just some leetcode prep would be plenty for FAANG."
"1120","I got into FAANG without going to meetups, and did about an hour of prep each day for a month (with 0 prior algorithm experience). I had prior work experience already.

I have a solid 10-6 WLB and WFH 1-2 days a week.

Not sure thats what people want to hear in this sub though."
"1121","That's dope, congrats. 
Just curious, what do you think of your experience with FAANG? I feel like a lot of people try to get to it because they don't really think about it and have that as their only goal. Do you think it should be as coveted as it is?"
"1122","I recently accepted a FAANG position for after I graduate.  My experience was that I was fine without having dedicated years to leetcode like I see people talk about here.  I have about 4 semesters of part-time dev work experience, a summer as a CS teaching assistant, a summer of CS research, and a few largely unrelated jobs on my resume.  I spent about two weeks total doing leetcode and reading over old algorithms class notes during class and for maybe an hour or two after I got home."
"1123","[deleted]"
"1124"," &gt;But in reality, most people are gonna need months-years assuming you aren't leetcoding 5 hours a day.

If you mean ""most"" as in ""most people that are grabbed randomly off the street"", then probably yes, as is intended.

If you mean ""most"" as in ""most people who are qualified to work at a FAANG and just need to improve on this one thing"", then I highly, highly doubt that. 

The questions aren't all that difficult (just went through multiple FAANG interviews last year), they mainly want you to show your thought process, plus a whole bunch were questions adapted from their work problems anyways, not from leetcode, so the grinding won't save you there. Not to mention at my level, the real killer is the system design interview. I fail far more people in this design round than in any other (I do 4-5 of these a week in my current role).

People who grind leetcode tend to miss the point of the interview and just go for raw memorization, and just hope they get something they knew from before, so no wonder they fail so much. People who are qualified for FAANG tend to already have pretty decent problem solving techniques and communication, so as long as they spend a few weeks brushing up on the basics, gain from any further prep is largely marginal.

And to reemphasize, if you're not entry level, and spend all your time leetcode grinding, you're gonna get destroyed by system design. Almost guaranteed. If you're gonna grind anything, grind that one."
"1125","[deleted]"
"1126","&gt; But leaving that aside, I feel the fact of the matter is, even if you have the proper thought process and communicate it accurately, the reality is, there could be other candidates that managed to do that and also get the question completely solved, which gives them an edge.

Obviously, you have to get the question right, my point is that if you have the proper thought process, then you basically don't need to grind for months/years, it's almost pointless given how marginal the benefits are. And the people who do grind, probably haven't mastered the thought process.

&gt; Is the final push that gets them the offer rather trivial? Yes, I'd say so, but it exists nonetheless, and serves the purpose of cutting down from many candidates to the amount of open positions. And again, something like this can only be answered by all of the companies releasing their interview evaluation process, leaving out our guesswork.

What push? I feel like you need to understand the interview process for FAANG before making ambiguous claims like this. The majority of positions aren't for individual teams, they're company wide, or at least org wide. You're not being compared against someone else directly, you're being compared against a bar (or a couple of bars), and as long as you pass that bar, you're a hirable candidate. Google and Facebook don't even assign you to a team until after the committee approves you. 

That bar isn't dependent upon how quickly you solved the leetcode. It's dependent on everything from your interview panel, of which the ""optimality"" of the solution to the algo question is but one thing. If you waste months/years just to get a mere 5% better at that one thing, it's only going to result in a trivial change in your overall panel results, if any.

* the caveat is that performance in the interview can be used to gauge your level, but that's mostly in system design and communication, not the algo panels. 

* and if you solve the leetcode too quickly, without properly explaining it, they'll assume you just remembered the solution and reject you anyways.

&gt; And again, would it be possible for the average cs grad from an average school to ace these interviews? Definitely, but the probability of that occurring is not in that students favour.

The point of these interviews is to weed out ""the average cs grad from an average school"". Because the average CS grad from the average school isn't qualified for FAANG. That's why I specified what ""most"" means. The point I'm making is that for the target demographic these interviews are designed for, there is no need to grind for years. If you're not qualified and want to become qualified, then yes, you have to prepare, but the preparation you need is holistic, not just leetcode grinding."
"1127","Absolutely not"
"1128","Nah, we out here G. We out here."
"1129","I think OP's sentiment was that getting a job at a place like Google isn't some incredible life achievement anymore (or at least this sub doesn't represent it as such)... Instead, getting in at Google is the new ""meeting expectations,"" which makes everything else come across a settling, if not outright failure. At least that's how I've come to understand the r/cscareerquestions metaculture. 

Getting a job at IBM, Intel, Oracle, etc. should be something to brag about. But on this sub the atmosphere is \~""why didn't you grind out a few more LCs? You could've been at Google instead of settling for IBM"""
"1130","&gt; the atmosphere is \~""why didn't you grind out a few more LCs?  

I think this type judgement is self inflicted. I've been on this sub for a while and haven't seen anyone actively shaming someone for not going for FAANG. If nobody is responding to your post or comment, it's probably because there is generally less knowledge about that company and how it operates, and not because people are judging you for not achieving or trying to achieve FAANG."
"1131","&gt; I think this type judgement is self inflicted. I've been on this sub for a while and haven't seen anyone actively shaming someone for not going for FAANG.

A-fucking-men to this and your longer comment above. People are tilting at windmills here about being criticize for their choice to not aspire to FAANG.

I have zero issues if you don't want to get into a FAANG. And I've never seen anybody else here having an issue with it either. I always ask for examples... and I never get any.

I have massive issue if you act like I don't have a life because I chose to spend a few weeks preparing for an interview that would massively boost the quality of the remaining decades of my life."
"1132","I mean perhaps people just dont want to invest the time and effort into searching the reddit history for examples of comments where people have shamed others for not going to faang. It would be a massive waste of time, afterall."
"1133","The fact that you'd have to hunt to find these comments just goes to show how rare they actually are.

Well, if you got a job at Oracle OCI, than you're TC is almost certainly 180K+. Oracle OCI is trying to poach Amazon talent by being slightly better than Amazon in every way (comp, benefits, WLB). That should qualify Oracle devs to feel like they are FAANG developers (most of them are)

I also work at one of these ""massively popular companies"" you're referring to (and earn pretty close to $400k).

Your two comments taken together seem to imply that ""having a life"" and ""working at one of these massively popular companies"" are two things that can't coexist. They most certainly can.

Most developers will never see 400k /yr in their entire life, even if they work double the hours as a senior developer at a reputable company in a high cost of living area.

Also, many people could spend 5+ years banging their head against LeetCode and still not be able to pass the medium/hards. The point I think the TC was getting at is that this sub often makes it sound like if you don't live and breathe CS, spending every waking moment of your life for potentially years mastering DS &amp; A and grinding gimmicky problems at LeetCode, you will not have a place in this industry or you'll simply be a code monkey earning $30k a year adjusting the fonts on web pages. What they probably actually mean is you probably won't have a place at a Big N, but since this is r/cscareerquestions and not r/bigNquestions people coming here for an overall look at the profession as a whole tend to get discouraged.

Let's be honest, there's not one person here who wouldn't like to work at a Big N. Who wouldn't want more prestige, more money, better benefits, etc. But not everyone can or is willing to put that level of effort into it."
"1152","alternate data point:

- did many MOOCs
- went to many meetups
- did some euler, hackerrank

got no job

Truth lies elsewhere"
"1153","Agreed. I work for a company most people have never heard of and I get paid very well, have fantastic quality of life, and like the people I work with. Looking at this sub made me wonder if I was living in an alternate reality. My experience has been that if you're capable and a decent person, that will get you just as far (if not further) than grinding algo problems (though I do like to do hackerrank problems for fun / because I like working with different algorithms and love computer science).

Alot of the people in this sub honestly remind me of the loudest and least capable kids from school, who fundamentally lack self awareness, and (in my mind) see comp sci as a means to an end rather than a beautiful, developing body of knowledge."
"1154","but, that's just not the field anymore is it? It may have been true 20 years ago that the majority of software engineers and computer scientists saw the field as a ""beautiful, developing body of knowledge"". But with all the money that's coming in, that's not the case anymore...and that's fine? I mean, no one goes after accountants and lawyers accusing them of being self-serving mercenaries, instead of pursuing some greater truth. People have to eat."
"1155","There is almost no job in this field won't immediately have you making more than the median for an entire households by yourself, if not multiple times that. The focus on FAANG in this sub is ridiculous because of that. Oh no, you're making slightly more than the median for the average household in the US just out of school. Poor you. 

I'm not saying money isn't important, but in most other fields, the pay is shit and then gets good. Even doctors who are the go to for money have shit pay in the beginning if you count the unpaid years long internship that is residency and then again if you consider the insane student loan burden they all have to carry. 

Not working at Google or whatever shouldn't be seen as the failure people make it out to be on this sub. That's just insanity for a career where no matter who you are, you are going to break 6 figures within the first decade and that's if you're very slow about it."
"1156","i agree with what you're saying, but i'm not sure why this is a reply to me...or how it's relevant to the point i'm making.

i only wanted to address the previous poster's assertion that we should expect new people to the industry to prioritize some beautiful platonic telos of the pursuit of knowledge over work as a ""means to an end""....i.e. as a means to, you know, live and do other things with life that aren't compsci.

very strange mentality to me."
"1157","That's fair, but you can't have it both ways then. There can't be this superior being FAANG hivemind mentality when really people are just chasing doe. Reminds me of people lining up for hours to get the new iPhone who's greatest new feature is there's no more headphone jack. Also, comp sci is the youngest distinct science we have. 20 years ain't shit. I think it's pretty cool that we get to be a part of shaping the conventions and direction of it, even though everyone doesn't need to feel that way."
"1158","Not to mention that, I think, a genuine passion for the subject as opposed to a strictly utilitarian approach, tends to lead to a better understanding. Also, this sub is called 'cscareerquestions', not 'devcareerquestions'."
"1159","HAHAHHA NOT BIG N DEV?! HAHAHHAHA"
"1160","I'm having a great time in my Hackspace tho. People here are chill as fuck. Nobody needs this, but I enjoy hanging out w people who understand that sitting around with your pc in silence is totally acceptable as a social experience."
"1161","or make way more and work less years in life with a massive saving?"
"1162","This entirely depends on region. Im im NYC and I cannot get a high quality job without practicing Leetcode for interviews"
"1163","So I'm not messing up by wanting to take time with learning how to be a 1337 hackerman and devoting half of my other time trying to find a place to live and build a life for myself?"
"1164","Some of us failed at both career and life tyvm"
"1165","They also dont realize theyre going to be forced to work 100 hours a week for that 120k starting salary.. and enjoy paying 4000 a month for a 1 bedroom lol"
"1166","Ironically, the most popular posts as of late in this sub are like this one. I see a new ""this sub sucks"" on my home feed every day."
"1167","this has been the case for quite a while, lol. the other commonality: they always wildly exaggerate how much time a (sane) person spends on leetcode. It always sounds like if you do leetcode, you're basically in some sort of Algorithm Prison where you spend all your waking hours digging trenches to trap rain water"
"1168","/r/cscqUnpopularOpinions"
"1169","Which doesn't make sense considering most people on this sub suggest NOT stressing over FAANG and leetcode"
"1170","At this point it's just posts seeking self validation.

You're fine if you don't leetcode or want to go faang. You don't have to knock others who do."
"1171","Exactly this. And the people that push the whole ""big companies in SF/Seattle aren't worth it because of high CoL"" narrative to cover their own insecurities. Thanks to them you have 22 year old new grads asking if they should turn down a job in SF to stay in Texas because of CoL. They are just as bad if not worse than the fang or nothing people."
"1172","maybe because the others outnumber those 15:1, and when this kind comes a lot of the ""silent majority"" feels it's time to jump in and write they agree"
"1173","You have the most blind-esque flair I've ever seen lol"
"1174","Honestly dont understand why mods dont delete low effort posts like this."
"1175","[deleted]"
"1176","Nope. Don't worry about it.

I've been a Senior SWE for many years and not even opened leetcode in my life. Sure if you wanna work at FAANG you'll probably need to do it at some point. But there are hundreds of thousands, probably even millions of good, well paying engineering jobs that won't test you on shit like that during the interviews.

You'll learn how to build algorithms and solve problems at work, you don't need to grind that shit to get jobs once you have experience. Despite what this sub makes you believe."
"1177","Ive worked at two FAANG companies and Ive never done leetcode. Ive hired many people too, and leetcode doesnt factor into my approach. 

To the OP: Stay curious, keep learning, find gaps in your org where you can become an expert. Over the long term, this generates a lot of value."
"1178","You could be lying."
"1179","You basically do have to grind it at least a little to get work straight out of school though."
"1180","I didn't, graduated on the east coast, put out a half dozen crappy resumes and got job offers for all of them.

Pretty much everyone I've talked to around here and graduated with has the same story, if people want real advice they really need to get specific as to the actual city they live in and are applying to because it must matter a ton..."
"1181","I didn't when I left university. I'm in the UK though, there appears to be a lot less SWEs here than in the US. I applied for about 10 roles to get my first junior role, if that. Had two offers in the end. It's totally different here."
"1182","You absolutely do not. You don't ever have to touch it or worry about it at all.

Everyone I knew during my CS degree had internships through-out , and before graduating we all had several job offers from companies.

I can't speak for all of the students, but me and my friends never did any leet code, in fact out of all the interviews I did for internships / graduation , I only had 1 company that asked any technical question at all. The rest were super chill and understood that if I made it through the CS degree, I could learn the job pretty damn easily, so it was mainly behavioral stuff.

This sub is so far removed from reality it's ridiculous."
"1183","Your experience is highly unique then. Im a MS student and Im graduating in June, with no internships and a few personal projects. Ive applied to almost 170 companies since January. Only got around 20 positive responses and, yes, every one of them was leetcode online assessments. Most of them were leetcode medium questions, which I couldnt answer because Im really shit at leetcode-style questions. Most of my friends havent found jobs and the only one who have were the ones who have were the ones who grinded leetcode last year. And no, Im not only applying to FAANG companies either. I wish I could find these companies all of you people are working at because I need a job and I hate doing leetcode"
"1184","Could just be that your resume isn't great? My understanding is that when someone looks at a resume, they're looking at it 10s at most. So for me I keep contact info, work history and a bunch of projects on the front, and then education and lists of programming languages and frameworks on the back.

Personally though I've met a fair amount of people with BS/MS degrees who don't know anything practical and people with no degree with basically doctorate-level knowledge so I guess there's something to be said about how much people actually understand their degree vs regurgitating their degree."
"1185","Ive had my resume worked on a lot, but yeah thats probably one reason. Unfortunately without internships theres not much you can do to make it look better."
"1186","I'd recommend heavily getting involved into an open source project, or more. That was vital to me getting my first job."
"1187","Did you avoid applying to larger companies? I haven't exactly been picky with where I have been applying. But the vast majority of companies I've interviewed with for internships have asked some form of technical question. 

Were you never asked to go in depth with any of your projects or past work experience? All of your interviews were purely behavioral?"
"1188","So basically ""my experience is better than yours""? =M"
"1189","My job had me write code to reverse a string for my interview. Now they have people do fizz buzz. They only care that you didnt lie about being able to code.

If youre a CS grad you probably dont need to grind any leetcode to do either of those problems."
"1190","""My job had me ________"" != The rest of the industry

Random companies in wisconsin are filtering out new grads with leetcode easy and mediums"
"1191","You definitely dont. Maybe a bit of a hot take but Id argue if youre a pretty good student you can pass some faang interviews with no leetcode."
"1192","This is what I want. I want a good work life balance. Time for my family. And decent pay. Hope it works out that way"
"1193","It's crazy that it's the norm for programmers to expect to code in their free time.

I got a 6 month kid, I got like 1-2 hours max of free time over in a day. Not like I will spend my only free time coding.

I try to do some pluralsight courses when I got time over at work. I see it as part of our routine as developers to keep learning.

But damnit that is on company time."
"1194","&gt;it's the norm for programmers to expect to code in their free time.

I don't think it's the norm, but I think the reason that many programmers also code in their free time is because many of us enjoy coding and creating things to make our lives easier. It's like mechanics who go home and work on their customized truck"
"1195","My logic is if I can't get paid to learn on company time, the place I work at sucks."
"1196","can we as a sub:

1. respect the ambitious who want to work hard to better their and their family's lives and

2. respect those who want to separate themselves from the grind and just work their 9-5s?

I don't understand why everyone on one side needs to shit on everyone on the other side. Both paths are perfectly reasonable.

But to respond to OP: I think grinding in the short term (couple of weeks to months) to ensure a better work experience (where we spend 8+ hours a day) and more pay (a lot of us come from tenuous financial situations or just like $ lol) is perfectly reasonable. I'm certainly happy I did so."
"1197","Its ridiculous lmao. Obviously people that want to talk about coding as a career in their free time will be more into their career than the average rando. Its just selection bias."
"1198","Exactly, in my free time instead of posting here I... well, I code, but fun stuff, my own enjoyable yet ultimately useless quixotic projects, not leetcode. I learn, but I'm motivated because I want to have more fun."
"1199","well said. thats one thing i never understood about this sub. both paths are completely valid and understandable, but people here have some sort of need to validate their own path by undermining others"
"1200","This is what i find so weird about this post. It's like patronizing a person who is trying to build a really fit body and not just satisfied with an average one. Some peoples lives revolve around their work rather than having babies and there is nothing wrong with it."
"1201","Highly disagree. The more accurate comparison is that there are people who think their life revolves around getting and staying fit and then becoming as fit as humanly possible.

The FAANG obsessed are the minority around who say you need to be grinding leetcode constantly and that they wont be happy until theyre making well beyond their means trying to retire at 30. Its honestly incredibly unhealthy and entirely unnecessary. You can satisfy both the above 2 criteria for the original commenters ability to respect others, but that minority has an unhealthy obsession with the dollar."
"1202","Although I don't agree with your opinion, I agree with why you're saying it: this sub combines the casual and hardcore crowds into one place, even though they have drastically different mindsets. It reminds me of /r/fitness and /r/bodybuilding. Maybe we should have a casual and hardcore version of CSCQ?"
"1203","&gt;The FAANG obsessed are the minority around who say you need to be grinding leetcode constantly and that they wont be happy until theyre making well beyond their means trying to retire at 30.

I've been here for years. I've never seen one of these posts.

What I have seen is several posts every week railing against these imaginary people, telling everyone that FAANG is actually bad, pushing BS about the cost of living canceling out FAANG compensation, and trashing everyone with the ambition to try to work there rather than take a job in Kansas."
"1204","Rather than take a job in Kansas. You seem to be one of them, implying if you dont have the ambitions to work in such a renowned area as the Bay area that youll be in fucking no where Kansas. Is that your argument and what youre implying? Because it seems to prove the argument I and others make."
"1205","I have no plans to take a job in Silicon Valley. I'm from a red state that most people would not consider a total backwater, and I plan to stay here for most of my career if so long as it is an option.

&gt;Is that your argument and what youre implying? Because it seems to prove the argument I and others make.

Let me reiterate since you did not read my comment:

&gt;&gt;The FAANG obsessed are the minority around who say you need to be grinding leetcode constantly and that they wont be happy until theyre making well beyond their means trying to retire at 30.

&gt;I've been here for years. I've never seen one of these posts.

My central point was that the vast majority of the circlejerking about FAANG on this sub is the people trashing FAANG, not the FAANGers or FAANG-wannabes preaching FAANG-or-bust. The post I see regarding FAANG are either FAANG-bashing or people simply asking what they should do to get in.

Your post was very hostile when to me, yet I was not hostile to you. I find that your post strongly validates the point that I've made. Thank you for doing a better job of arguing my point than I did."
"1206","Says the person who refers to non Silicon Valley as kentucky. Sure, sure did prove your point for ya though!"
"1207","Then in a blink of an eye you're old and frail and realize you literally wasted away your life making some other guy rich.

Wake up. There is more to life than work. You NEED a balance."
"1208","why is this myth constantly being perpetuated in this sub. earning a lot of money does not equate to working long hours. you can have your cake and eat it too"
"1209","Because 1.) they heard a rumor about it on this sub and 2.) they failed to get into FAANG so its their way of saying I wouldnt want to work there anyways."
"1210","Counterpoint: You can grind early and reap the rewards of your investment for the rest of your life. Your advise is like telling 18 year olds not to become doctors because they have to grind too hard for the next 10 years. You can work hard early in your career and still manage great relationships, health, and hobbies. And then you can ease into a comfortable work-life balance for the rest of your life and reap the return on the investment you made. 

I worked hard in my 20s and live a very balanced life in my early 30s, I'll be retired before I'm 40. And I sacrificed nothing important to do it; I guess I watched a little less TV and drank a bit less than my peers."
"1211","But this is a bit the point he refers to imo, that implying you are better of working hard in 20s to retire ""early"" whatever that means, and this is something to strive for. Why can't people just enjoy what they do without ""buuut what if you did X for some years! hah!""

For example me, I LIKE to work in software companies and learn and do real world stuff. I am NOT looking to retire early even if I could, but yet a lot of people need to tell that all the time how good it is"
"1212","True. I guess I felt like the choice presented was either have a life or focus on career advancement. There's definitely a way to do both. Maybe that was their point too."
"1213","This is what I don't get as well. Imagine patronizing everyone that works hard and has ambition. If everyone followed their advice, their would be no doctors, businessmen, scientists, etc."
"1214","How? Its a win win relationship, Im happy with my 250k TC too.

People always assume high TC = No WLB. IT DOESNT. You only need to grind 2-3 months for searching jobs"
"1215","This comment is the problem. Just grind 2-3 months. Not even remotely true for everyone. Some people simply struggle with leetcode, even after grinding for a while. And thats fine. But backhanded comments shoving your total compensation around like you are is exactly the kind of negative attitude OP speaks about.

You can be proud of your life without arrogance."
"1216","Then don't do it? THERE ARE TONS OF COMPANIES OUT THERE DON'T ASK LEETCODE. I do Leetcode because I want my 200k TC, that's all. 

Remember noone force you to do Leetcode, if you are happy with your salary and don't want to do it, it's totally fine."
"1217","You can care about that and not shove dollar amounts in everyones face which is the point. Its a pretty backhanded comment. Feel free to live your life and Ill make $200K TC. We get it, you make more than most people. The way you keep bringing it into every comment is the point youre missing."
"1218","I bring it up because I want to show my point on Leetcode, if it makes you feel uncomfortable then Im sorry."
"1219","It doesnt its just out of place. People are well aware via levels and other sights how much FAANG makes (200-300K). Pushing YOUR salary as your defense is the difference. But its all good"
"1220","[deleted]"
"1221","Im sure you have the wrong idea about Leetcode, if you memorize, you are doing it wrong. I never memorize anything, I do enough to know the pattern. 

And again, nobody force you to do Leetcode. THERE ARE TONS OF COMPANIES OUT THERE DON'T ASK LEETCODE. If you are happy with your salary, it's fine, do you way.

But If you want more than 200k, you do Leetcode, it's simple."
"1222","It's not a one way street, it's fairly naive to think that just because you make more money means you have to work more."
"1223","Then in a blink of an eye you're old and frail and realize you wasted away your life trying to barely provide for your kids with a 60K salary which was not even enough for their college tuition and left you with an abysmal retirement corpus. Or instead you could have grinded leetcode/cs for a year to change your as well as your children's lives."
"1224","Not even true in this industry. Most jobs in this field are life changing for a family. Jfc"
"1225","[deleted]"
"1226","Nothing wrong with that at all. Most people need to live a little and leave more to their life than their career."
"1227","Or you can fat* FIRE your 200k income working 10 hour days making your bosses wealthy and retire in your early 50's with well over 10 million in savings and do whatever you want after that. Who cares, there are plenty of roads to Rome, dude."
"1228","that's not lean FIRE lol."
"1229","Youre right, 10 mill retirement definitely wouldnt be lean. What I meant to say is that you just have to save almost all of your income to that point, but thats still Fat FIRE."
"1230","Just when I want to enjoy free time. When I hit my 50's!"
"1231","50s is still fairly young, especially if you lead a healthy lifestyle. Not like most FAANG SWEs hate their jobs that much until that point anyway."
"1232","So.. You want folks to retaliate to ""the wealthy man"" by making themselves objectively poorer? Seems legit. Fuck the system, eh?"
"1233","Then pick better work and make yourself rich. Build a business and begin to provide for others families in addition to your own. 

Everyone's needed balance is different."
"1234","To use the metaphor, it sounds like he takes issue with spending 3 or 4 hours at the gym every day, being disappointed with the results and then obsessing over a certain level of fitness.  At a certain point, it's not healthy."
"1235","[deleted]"
"1236","Idk why you got downvote, what you said has some merit. This field has poor retention rate amongst certain groups people. If this industry focused on treating employees with some real concern, things would be better."
"1237","People shit on the other group because, deep down, they're very insecure. Abd shitting all over the other group helps them with that. That is sadly how humans work."
"1238","&gt; I don't understand why everyone on one side needs to shit on everyone on the other side.

No one is 'shitting' on anyone really. We have these posts at least once a week and they all follow the same pattern. They're just meant to pull on your heart strings to get attention/karma, nothing more."
"1239","Once a week is an understatement!"
"1240","Well said. Reddit reflects a small portion of the industry and those that post represent an even smaller portion of the community. Usually those most willing to speak up will have stronger opinions in either extreme. As a community, the onus is on us to keep checks-and-balance amongst *all* perspectives. As individuals, well, hopefully we have the resolve to filter out what should or shouldn't be relevant; Catch-22 I suppose."
"1241","thank you for acknowledging there's two sides. some people enjoy coding and such. others don't. Both are fine.


There's no shame in wanting to just work a 9-5 and have a lot of free time. There's no shame in wanting to grind and try to get a high paying job straight out of college. 


Some people want to spend their free time coding and others see it as work because they also code at work and maybe I'm wrong, but you can do work activities in your free time for fun. And there's nothing wrong with that."
"1242","I would add about programmers from third world countries. For most of them landing a job at Big N means literally 10x increase in TC and overall quality of life."
"1243","This sub's work culture truly is bizarre. The subtle ways people here justify their opinions is more telling than the explicit points themselves:

Describing having an unhealthy work attitude as being more ambitious than having a healthy work attitude speaks volumes, CSCQ! The learned association of ambition with career is not usual. People who choose to work less and focus on everything else in life are just as ambitious, and additional effort spent working would be time taken away from their ambitions, folks here just can't recognise ambition that doesn't align with their own obsessions.

I also find the attempt to justify excess work as a pro-family move to be painfully ironic.

Of course, ultimately; live and let live. I just find the justifications used by communities with unhealthy work-life attitudes to be fascinating - reading CSCQ can be fascinating and it all comes out in threads like this. It's okay to just admit that increasing personal career-status and wealth provides a validation in one's life. No need to try and convince each other their hobby brings superiority or is altruistic."
"1244","A new sub might be easier at this point"
"1245","r/9to5devs someone make it!"
"1246","Can I ask what region you work in? I live in San Francisco and leetcode is literally all I'm asked from startups to larger companies. Frankly I'm tired of it; it's demeaning and feels like hazing.

Especially those that marathon leetcode questions in succession and under high pressure. Like, wtf? When I finish those it feels like my head is going to explode.

I'm currently working at a place that was less leetcode-y but I'm no longer enjoying living in San Francisco and I'm ready to move but I'm terrified of jumping back into a leetcode grind.

I just want to live a chill life in a chill place and SF is completely the opposite"
"1247","My 2 cents and ymmv New York's hedge funds and investment banks are desperate for developers, and none of them asked leetcode question, I found an awesome job in two months."
"1248","How did you go about this?  I currently do quant stuff on my own time, it works really great for personal investing.  Scaling it, running a multi million dollar fund would be very different but for now I'm happy with my alpha.

I wouldn't mind trying something like that though, what kind of interview questions do they ask?  I was toying with the idea of amazon, but saw a lot of their interview questions were very leetcode-ish.  I feel I could do it, but arrive at the optimal solution in 30 or so minutes?  I don't know about that one.  Its making me feel really stupid tbh.  What I do now works great and it consists of running into a problem, taking a crack at it and then going to google/stack if I can't get it.  Seems like once you get the hang of leetcode it becomes easier but damn its really something."
"1249","Developers/SEs at banks or funds are separate from quant/strat roles.  The dev function is mostly similar to what you'd do in tech, though obviously oriented toward finance.  Quant/strat/researcher roles require   additional quantitative training, usually an advanced degree (ie, a CS BS won't likely cut it)"
"1250","makes sense, I don't mind doing it on the side and doing dev work in the industry at least."
"1251","Yeah I'm just  dev certainly no quant. The quants need developers."
"1252","Mmhm, y'all do more hardcore programming, we (strats) still code but do more quantsy stuff as well."
"1253","Thanks for the tip, going to start targeting them more."
"1254","It's not just fintech.  Many mid-to-senior level roles in NYC prefer to ask domain questions over leetcode-type questions.  (""Many"", not ""all"", because there are always exceptions.)

Even when I've been asked algo questions here, they're of the ""Find the 2nd smallest value in an unordered array""-type of question, not the more advanced stuff you'd need a LC Premium account to see.

Take-home exams are also getting vastly more popular.... but YMMV on whether that's a good thing or not."
"1255","What are the names of these companies or how do I find them in other cities? Do I just google city financial tech company?"
"1256","Move. The San Fran tech scene breeds this ""work till you die"" toxic mentality. If you want a cushy job where you're not being pushed to 150% every day and can ""turn off"" when you get home, then move to a lower cost of living place and and look for a job at an older, most established enterprise (they tend to be more lax to the point of glacial). 

I'm 3 years out of college making just at six figures in a city where the median income is less than $50k. No, I don't live in the middle of nowhere either.- RVA is a hugely trendy ""up and coming"" city, but I've been here most my life. The food and social scene is great and that's all I care about. I was able to buy a house here last year completely on my own, paid off my student loans debts fast, have great benefits, and hardly have any stress from my job all at only 25 years old. Sure, it moves a little slow for my liking and can be frustrating with the red tape, but I wouldn't trade it over a breakneck ""up or out"" job like out West for anything."
"1257","I work in downtown SF for 40 hours with 0 expectation to work extra regularly lol"
"1258","At most Bay area companies you can just not show up for half the day without telling anyone and no one cares.

I don't know where the rumor of these companies having a ""work to death"" culture started from. I can't imagine a more cushy lifestyle."

"1263","&gt;and look for a job at an older, most established enterprise (they tend to be more lax to the point of glacial).

Even the more established big companies can push for things a bit.  I worked for a big established company recently that was changing the way they did their annual employee reviews, and they added a requirement where they wanted their employees to always be learning - So on the annual reviews, one thing they'd start to look at now is whether the employee had done any learnings/trainings, etc., and if not, that could count against you.  Also, for employee performance, they tended to believe in a bell curve where there are supposedly always some employees toward the bottom end of the bell curve, who would need to be put on an improvement plan or let go..

Also, as a big company, they had offices in multiple countries, and sometimes teams would have work split across multiple continents, so sometimes people would have to get on an online meeting after normal working hours to talk to team members in other continents."
"1264","Yeah my only expectations for personal growth is I have an annual budget of $2k I can use on courses, certifications, or conferences. Doesn't matter what it is but I have to do at least something."
"1265","yep, in Europe a lot of big companies from car to banking industry also start like a ""agile side department"" or whatever fancy name they call it. Basically something that is not internal IT development that is meant to create new thinking solutions that could be used internal and external. Then you don't even need to worry about raising series X funding"
"1266","Ive worked in SF for 8 years I would say many, many more people work 40 hours here than the ones being pushed 150%.

There are plenty of people with normal lives outside work, those who are married/kids, who hang out with friends, do sports/exercise, etc."
"1267","Lemme guess. You're a C1 SWE?"
"1268","Not even, I refuse to work for them. I even go so far as to advise other junior developers to avoid them. Incredibly toxic PR practice. Known for massive layoffs every two years because of their ""up or out"" mentality. It's just like working for a SFran company except without actually being there. I'd rather move to another city and work for someone else if they were the last and only choice available to me here."

"1272","Lot of people here are completely out of touch with reality. I have moments where Im on this sub all the time then get completely annoyed with the kids who think they know what they are talking about and take a break. Making less than 130k doesnt make you a failure. Social skills and being a team player is more important than the git gud at leetcode attitude. 

My first job payed shit but my second job payed significantly more. Not because I grinded leetcode but because I made friends and people liked me. I was able to go through one of the easiest interview processes ever and land a nice cushy and stable job."
"1273","Lmao dude thats a little disingenous saying you can just make friends and be liked. At the end of the day, a business hires you to be good and make them money. If you sucked ass at your job but were super likeable, normally youd be fired in a heartbeat for some nerd with no social skills but actually provided more value."

"1275","Don't buy into the hype.   


I stopped going to coding/dev focussed meetups years ago. Originally I felt somewhat obligated to go to these things too. Maybe to network or learn something new. They ended up being a large waste of time, at least for me. I've made better connections on LinkedIn. I've learned more through online courses and reading online documentation than through a few hours of cramming in a free evening training session.  


I've had plenty of hobbies outside of work and hopefully you continue to do what makes you happy outside of work too. If I may recommend a few: motorcycles, traveling, paintball and weed."
"1276","No, do not be discouraged. I've been a software development professional for 4 years, never opened leet code, nor went to a meet-up, and have only coded at work since I graduated college.

This sub is a tiny sample size of a huge industry. I'm beginning to code and learn outside of work now to prepare for another job. I have a family and have to balance work and life.

I handle the pressure I see here and other programming subs by remembering that (maybe) 10% of this site's traffic are active contributors to the posts we see and everyone else lurks. If we are only seeing 1/10 experiences/opinions, what to do the others have to say?"
"1277","They are saying ""oh I'm taking a break until then I'll ask my dad/mom/uncle for a job"""
"1278","Look, it sucks, but the leetcode grind is necessary, however, only in highly competitive tech hubs. Im an entry-level dev in NYC. EVERY. SINGLE. COMPANY. asks leetcode style questions or system design/oop questions. Even the no-names. I have zero FAANG aspirations, in fact Ive applied to none. The companies Ive applied to no one has heard of, yet they all conduct the same style of interview. Frankly, its madness.

And Im not just a sample size of one. Im involved in a NYC-run program that helps entry-level devs, CS students enter the field. There are over 200 students. Half of the curricula is technical interview prep/hackerrank/leetcode review! I know so many bright students from all kinds of backgrounds, colleges, etc that have sent out (literally) hundreds of job apps, that have to grind leetcode nonstop just to land a job at some no-name company (myself included). Theres dedicated slack communities to this shit. 

There are a lot of reassurances and whatnot in here, but I think thats a disservice to people who live in highly competitive tech hubs/or want to work in one. Their  job search experience is not going to match what its like to get a job in the UK or Canada or even the middle of the country. You shouldnt be scared, but you should know that if you want to work in ANY company in a major tech hub, its likely going to involve dumb leetcode style questions. Its bullshit and I hate it, but its the reality."
"1279","+1, recruiting for relevant companies in industry hubs is significantly different to recruiting for random companies outside of industry hubs."
"1280","Perhaps it's just an ""entry-level"" thing?  I _literally_ haven't been asked a typical leetcode-type in NYC, and most of my colleagues haven't.  It's usually domain questions and take-home exams for people here."
"1281","That's wild, so far it's been online coding challenges followed up by leetcode-style interviews for me."
"1282","&gt; I don't see the point in grinding programming problems for several hours

The point of preparing for DS&amp;A interviews is... to prepare for an interview at a company that does DS&amp;A interviews. If the company you're interviewing at doesn't do those kinds of interviews... then obviously you don't need to do it.

For me personally:

* I spent a few weeks before my FAANG interview preparing. I *too* never opened Leetcode in a browser! But I did review DS&amp;A in ... gasp! ... my own free time (using books and pencil and paper).
* I now work for my dream company, on what I think is the coolest software in the world.
* I earn 3x more than I did at my previous job.
* I average less than 40 hours work per week.
* I have a great life outside of work.

&gt;  or excluding everything out of my life except CS.

Nobody here has ever said anybody should do that. And I certainly don't. Again... all I did was spend a few weeks preparing for my interview.

At my previous job, where DS&amp;A interviews weren't required... I earned about 1/3 of what I do here. I also averaged more hours per week, and the stuff I was working on was mind-numbing and I hated it.

So yes, I sacrificed a few weeks of my own time studying DS&amp;A. In return I have improved the next several decades of my life immeasurably. If you can't understand why I chose that tiny sacrifice for a massive gain, then I can't help you.

&gt; How do you guys handle the pressure that you get here?

I don't get any pressure here, except for pressure from people like you implying my choices are silly and impossible to understand.

If you're happy where you are and with what you had to do to get there... fucking fantastic for you! If somebody wants to study DS&amp;A to get into a certain company... fucking fantastic for them! I have no idea what pressure you're referring to.

&gt; Should I be worried about my future.

Why do you need this sub to tell you what to worry about? Especially when in the same breath you are criticizing this sub for giving unrealistic advice?

If you got your current job and think you can keep getting jobs you want after that... then no you probably shouldn't worry.

If you want to work at a place that does DS&amp;A interviews, but you refuse to prepare for them... then yes you probably should worry."
"1283","If your employer is allowing you to learn and develop your skills on the job, you are good to go. If you are not learning and developing your skills on the job, it is likely that whenever the tech you are working with becomes obsolete, you will too. 

Our industry is in a constant slow churn of technology (with some snap changes as well). You must follow it, move into management quickly, or exit it."
"1284","&gt;If your employer is allowing you to learn and develop your skills on the job

I've never asked. I just learn regardless on the job. It's part of your job, your career.. To learn new stuff."
"1285","I get 15% of my time mandated for training,its pretty sweet."
"1286","I don't disagree at all. Some folks here don't do that or they feel too pressured by production deadlines to invest in themselves.

"1290","Graduate student here. Same. Haven't done any internship or got a job yet. And tried my hands on leetcode for a while but got instantly demotivated by the sheer number of problems and the fact that there are way too many skilled people over there who are better than me on every aspect. I'm just trying to not take all these too seriously and just focus on my personal projects and learning as much as I can on my own. Hope that the future will be kind to me. But honestly leetcode (and other competitive coding websites) seems like a way too sophisticated thing with nearly not as much use. But that's my personal opinion."
"1291","&gt;demotivated by the sheer number of problems and the fact that there are way too many skilled people over there who are better than me on every aspect.

You dont need to be the best, theres plenty of demand for cs people. Even those who are working at average or below average companies are doing better than most people outside the industry."
"1292","This gives me hope. Thanks"
"1293","This gives me hope too.

Thank you!"
"1294","You don't need leetcode and you don't need to work for FAANG. Lots of great jobs in the software industry that would gladly have you."
"1295","Don't quote me on this but... Even at a FAANG, you're not likely to use much more complicated than a hashtable on a regular basis.

My work life balance is pretty great. There is some pressure to stretch yourself (especially around performance review time) but I'm not working 60 hours or anything.

I also was in the startup world before where Leetcode was not something that most people did, and it was totally fine too. Making the jump to Big G was something of a long term goal of mine for quite a while, so I put in the (pretty significant) effort to get through the interviews when they came calling. But it's totally not required. I keep in touch with folks from previous (startup) jobs and they're plenty happy."
"1296","Most FAANG job interviews don't require anything harder to understand than a hash table. Occasionally you'll get thrown a legitimately hard interview question, but more often than not you're not even expected to finish it, but rather to do a good job communicating your thought process.

A few companies have high bars, but it doesn't take that much in general. The interview cycles take time and can be frustrating, but it's surprising not that hard to get in with a few tries."
"1297","FWIW my SWE onsite interview involved graphs twice, concurrency once (system design), and a trie. Maybe I got the dreaded interview antiloop though."
"1298","At the end I believe it all comes down to what your hobbies are and what you like to do in your spare time. Some people like to keep learning new technologies at home, or maybe do some LeetCode just for the sake of learning. Then there are people who like to disconnect from work and forget everything about software development. And then there are people who are like a mix of both. They like to hang out with friends, family, etc but still find the time to learn new technologies. There's not only one way to go in life. Just choose whatever that works for you."
"1299","This sub doesnt represent anything I know. Im in the same boat - I never code outside of work. I love spending time with my family, reading and playing video games occasionally."
"1300","Your doing it the right way. 

Your more than your TC .

Half the posts here are ' I'm so alone, I have no interest at all aside from coding and non of my co workers have even offered to arrange me a marriage' 

It's more important to do real social things, ( Snapchat and Tinder don't count ) and to build real friendships. 

Enjoy life"
"1301","I'm UK based, 10 years in, never done leet code or attended a meet up or hack day outside of work (have been to a couple where I was required to with work).

As long as you are continuing to learn on the job, and staying on top of things, you should be good, just have a look at the market every 6 months or so and try and stay relevant, but this doesnt mean you need to attend meetups or grind leetcode.

A lot of companies use the same libraries, frameworks and technologies, they're looking for someone who is capable and a good fit for the team, not someone who can smash out leetcode questions.

Granted I don't work for a FAANG, but I'm well compensated and provides me with a lot of time to do the things I actually want to do, and as I get older thats what I'm starting to value more."
"1302","I don't do that stuff either. Neither do my coworkers. Even my friends from school who went to FAANG companies only did that stuff for a couple months to prep for interviews. 

I can't answer the question if we're doing the *right* thing, but I can say based on the amount of recruiter emails I still get on a daily basis... I'm not worried.

Edit: possibly relevant, I've been out of school working for about 6 years at small companies in a non-tech-hub metro area (Philadelphia) yet I've never had trouble finding a job I'm satisfied with at all. I understand it's different if you're aiming for extremely competitive areas, but I specifically can't be bothered with those types of atmospheres and prefer a laid back (if less cutting edge) working environment."
"1303","I graduated and found a job in the first 4 weeks. I practiced a bit of leet code, but for the position I'm in now, never had to do any leetcode questions. Throughout my schooling for 6 years, I worked on projects that interested me and it helped build a good skill foundation for coding. Some weekends I spend time working on projects and tutorials to accelerate my learning. I'm working on the front and backend of a rather complicated realtime data application. The subject matter of the app isn't as exciting as self driving cars or building software for space exploration, but the work is challenging enough to keep me interested. 2 years after graduation, I am a technical lead for Android development and work on frontend and backend .NET.

The great thing about this industry right now is that job seekers have a lot of leverage because the skills are in such high demand. Which means if you don't want to make your entire life all about your career, you don't have to! Just show up to work and make an effort to do a quality job, make a decent living, go home and live your life how you see fit. If you want to do a little extra sometimes, it can help accelerate your career if you choose your subject matter carefully.

Hell, if I had started in this field much younger, before I had a family of my own, I'd be able to save soooooo much money that I'd just save and invest. I'd be much better off, and already have a decent house with a decent sized nest egg already in my mid 30s.

If you aren't into the competitive CS world as a student, practicing on leetcode and going to hackathons, don't worry about the big tech companies. That is stress you can do without. If you wanna try, make your best effort but don't expect to get in. There is plenty of work out there beyond big tech that pays quite decent. If you're worried about enjoying what you do, well, work is work. What makes the biggest difference in a work place is the work ethic culture. Some places demand more of you than you want to give, others are relaxed and understand that you want work life separation. The company I work at is more the latter, and again, was never asked a leetcode question. What probably got me put ahead of other candidates was my portfolio webpage that built displaying my academic accomplishments like my GPA (3.8) and my projects, both academic and personal.

Definitely practice leetcode. Definitely invest time and effort. But you don't have to make it your whole life. Hang in there and keep applying. Sell yourself on your soft skills as much as any technical skill. Be confident in interviews, and try to prepare questions for your interviewers because that is always impressive when a candidate appears to know what they are looking for out of their working environment."
"1304","&gt; I never opened Leetcode in my browser

I don't know what this means

&gt; never went to a meetup

Me either tbh

&gt; and I only code at work

Lots of other people do this too....that's called having a life outside work. I think you'll find that plumbers don't go round in their free time looking for toilets to unblock.

&gt; I have a normal life outside of work and I can pursue great hobbys where coding is not a part of.

Awesome!

&gt; Should I be worried about my future.

No.

&gt;I don't see the point in grinding programming problems for several hours or excluding everything out of my life except CS. 

Agree.

&gt;How do you guys handle the pressure that you get here?

If a company is trying to make you do this stuff on a weekend against your will, then they're a shitty company. Lots of people have side-projects that they work on outside of work (I do), some of those are code based....and some aren't. For example, I have a bunch of GitHub projects...but I also play with 3D printing, my wife and I enjoy watching movies and hiking.

As other people are saying - this sub is a bubble. Stop reading these stories about people who sleep under their desk and work 48 hour weeks, then go get drinks with their coding bros after midnight and live at work. 

TL;DR: Leave work at work. Enjoy life outside work. Have fun. A job exists so that you can do things you enjoy in your free time."

"1321","The competition is ridiculous, but the expectations for new hires are absolutely absurd. Im in NYC and it took me 5 months after graduating to land my first role and after getting laid off a year later it took me 3 months to find another job. While I wasnt grinding leetcode much I was still grinding nonstop(applying to jobs, learning relevant tech, udemy courses). I was on my computer for like 8-10hrs a day trying to get a job. Only to get some interest from companies that wont pay more than 75k, which is absolutely nothing in NYC."
"1322","This sub reflects the competitive tech hubs or areas with significant industry outside of FAANG. I'm not just talking the bay area either. For those who think that isn't the case, go check the market and apply to positions you don't have an inside connection to. You might be quite surprised. 

Interviews outside of this trend I've been through were normal but were locations I didn't want to live in. Companies in most tech hubs seem to be outsourcing their hiring for developers and those groups are mirroring processes used in the bay area. The companies' HR groups are none the wiser but there's likely enough competition that people jump through these sort of ridiculous processes. There are exceptions you just have to dig around awhile."

From that perspective, i didnt really care what hoops i had to jump or whether i agreed with the usefulness of the challenges or not

I generally come back to this sub to offer advice if i can and celebrate the wins of others who struggled too.

The obsession with money and prestige - just ignore it. If thats what makes some happy, to each their own. If you know what makes you happy, should be easy to ignore the things you dont find helpful here.

"1349","i dont get why this sub scares you? its mostly young people asking how to get a job. i dont get it. you have a job."
"1350","Why does a subreddit scare or pressure you? Why are you so insecure about your life choices? Maybe see a therapist first.

Every other day there's posts like these asking for validation about not trying for FAANG. If you want to work at a FAANG, go for it. If you don't want to work at a FAANG, don't."
"1351","[deleted]"
"1352","second guy who's mentioned this today.  What is it like up there?  Currently in Northern Virginia.  Seems a lot of companies are doing the leetcode thing.  I've been doing solo projects (stock trading) for awhile and its been great, very stressful to make everything on your own though so I wouldn't mind a 9-5 that offers similar comp for a bit.  Talking with amazon though, they wanted the leetcode stuff right off the bat."
"1353","yeah wtf is leetcode?"
"1354","Sub scares me too. Keep doing your own thing my dude!"
"1355","I used to be obsessed with the big companies right when I got out of college but now that I've been out for about ten years I'm pretty happy living in a low cost of living area in the suburbs in the Midwest. Sure I may not be building annex Google maps but it is great to be near family."
"1356","For better and worse, this sub is 90% guys who want to play the FAANG game. There are many other people out there... they just don't post here often except for the occasional ""I've been in the industry X years and this is why I hate this sub post"" ... and the cycle continues.

My suggestion: read the good posts here and/but set your own goals."
"1357","That's normal. If you're happy where you are, there's no reason to constantly strive for something that you don't even know if you want. The most I do outside of work is read books and articles related to the tech I work with and general things about software engineering (Clean Code, for example, or other project management/refactoring/etc. books).

I have no interest in FAANG so why waste my time preparing for it when I'm well-prepared for any other ""normal"" company interview?"
"1358","Is it this sub or the web in general ? it seems a lot of crowd is communicating a lot on being leet to the power of hacker."
"1359","Thank you for sharing! Im currently a junior in CompSci and this sub was making my senior year seem stressful."
"1360","Omg not at all, I've been in the industry for 10 years and I never required all of that, I've worked with great companies and faang follows me every year asking me to interview, which I don't want because I have a great job and no need to kill myself for their objectives... Don't worry of what you listen here"
"1361","Well, for me it was a couple months of high pressure grinding leetcode and prepping for interviews, which led to a great offer at a rly good company doing something I really want to do."
"1362","Jesus christ, this is actually a dream of a post. Reddit seems to really inflate things and only ask ""well why aren't you earning 80k+ in central London after 3 years experience"".

Does actually make you feel inadequate as like OP I'd never touched leetcodes until about a month ago, and now according to these poxy recruiters, most companies in London use them in interviews.

Best advice I can give on anything, is to do you. Accept a salary you're happy with and dont compare to other. If you need to do a few algorithm based leetcodes based on interviews then crack on but if not who cares, it wont be used day to day.

Redit is just one big subtle brag"
"1363","The meetup stuff is mostly if programming related things are your hobby. You'll be fine without them. 

The leetcode grind is a temporary investment of time if you are or expect to soon be on the job hunt. It's just a fact of the industry in many places and you are largely doing yourself a disservice by not practicing."
"1364","Nah, this sub's culture is largely focused on the competitive, high-paying roles. If you live in a good city finding work won't ever be all that difficult for you (if you aren't an idiot that knows nothing). That being said, there are quite a lot of companies who will leetcode you, so when you go looking, you should prepare. The first job is the easiest to get, IMO. They don't expect you to know much. When you're going for non-entry level, they will likely put you through at least a few tasks to verify you're not a mouth-drooler. But, even then, a lot of the time it's minimal. An easy leetcode (basic string manipulation or some such). A discussion about how you would design a system. Some conversation about technologies on your resume. Nothing insane.   


If you want to step into known brand companies, you should be prepared to compete. And the rewards are pretty substantial comparatively. 6-figure salaries, great bullet points, travel for enrichment benefits, the chance to speak at conferences, develop expertise in significant technologies, exposure to cutting edge architecture designs, etc... But, if you just want a 9-5 with an OK salary, you can always get that if you're willing to move for a company."
"1365","So many of these posts keep cropping up. Like geez, a big part of this career is searching stuff up and filtering all the things non-applicable to your specific use case.

Its not that hard really. Ive been a part of this sub for almost four years, since I was a sophomore in college. Before we had 100,000 members. Theres plenty of valuable information on this subreddit. you just need to take the time to look for it, instead of just looking salary sharing threads, or am I doomed clickbait posts."
"1366","I usually just skim through and skip the leer code and try hard CS posts. No offense to anyone who finds that intriguing and pursues that approach in their career. I mainly just read the posts that are relevant to me and that I can relate with or contribute to. 

Im in the same boat as OP,I have never done leetcode, dont do meetups. I have a family, I code personal projects that solve issues for me while learning new frameworks or to challenge myself. I do some custom raspberry pi setups, and diy house stuff. To each his own."
"1367","Not at all, unless you have reasons to believe that you will need to do that for something that you might need in the future (i.e. your job scope requires it, or you are interested in moving to a company with an interview process that involves training on LeetCode)."
"1368","I take everything with a grain of salt and usually do not take everything I read on here seriously."
"1369","Congratulations! youve achieved being a normal human with interests outside of work! Dont sweat it."
"1370","I'm like you most of the time. But once a year I decide to do a couple of interviews at other places just to keep myself sharp. I like leetcode because it's fun AF, and the nature of interviews has changed so much from gotcha questions to actually meaningful questions that reflect how it's going to be to work there.

As for meetups, a lot of them are a waste of time. You should do them when you're new in the industry though, because you'll get an idea of what everyone else is doing in your city, and where all the other jobs are. I'd go to some maybe once every few months. 

But really, meetups can be a waste of time unless they are on a topic you care about, or by an organization you find interesting. 

These are optional activities you can do to keep your career instincts sharp. I've been in this industry for a decade, and I've realized jobs don't last forever. I worked someplace for five years and one day all of a sudden my whole team was out on our asses. So it's important to keep those instincts sharp and a network going. You don't ""need"" to do them, but they are to save your ass when life hands you a tough one."
"1371","Been in the field for 3+ years now and my experience is the same as yours. Nothing to worry about."
"1372","It might not matter in the job, but it will in some interviews with big companies.

I had to do 2 programming challenges from Facebook. And then 2 more on a whiteboard in person. Obviously leetcode here was good for that preparation.

And literally NOBODY in this sub thinks you should be grinding leetcode for the job. ONLY for the interview."
"1373","The Leetcode, Odin Project, Project Euler suggestions tend to be for people who express anxiety or a genuine newness to coding. I would say for someone who's still a student like me, it's pretty sound advice. But if you're comfortable in everything and still feel pretty sharp, yeah don't worry tbh."
"1374","There are many ways to define success.  You should do you and compare yourself to the goals you want to attain within your career.  There is no point in comparing yourself to others because they have different career goals than you do."
"1375","Do y'all have any internship/new-grad-full-time opportunities there by any chance?"
"1376","Are you me?  You might be me.  


I've worked for two different companies in the almost 2 years since graduation, getting promoted at the first job.  Each job was more interested in whether I could design a working complex program, model to UI.  They were also more concerned about my fit socially with the team.  


Is the work I do challenging?  Not particularly.  But I'm still getting paid well enough to enjoy a fantastic Lake Michigan view while paying down college debt.  More importantly, my life isn't dominated by CS."
"1377","Honestly, what you have seems pretty normal. I have a friend who is very similar to you, except he used to do projects and hackathons a lot. After finally getting a job and doing it full-time, coding wasn't a fun thing for him in his free time. He's ok with coding at work and not at home and that's totally ok. 

Some people genuinely enjoy it to do it at work and at home, but that's understandably not for everyone. You'll be fine."
"1378","90% of the advice doled out here is from people who have demonstrated they have absolutely no idea what theyre even talking about.  More often than not, this sub is like a bad Hollywood version of what its like having a career in computer science.  So, theres that."
"1379","I've long ago stopped actually paying attention to this sub, unless I have a specific question. Then it's probably been asked before, so I just search it up and see what the answer was. If I listened to half the posts here I'd have already quit.

Actually there was one time I had a specific question about resume building, I asked it in the weekly thread, and nobody responded to it at all. So that was useful."
"1380","Most people love to exaggerate or lie about how busy they are, enjoy your life and dont buy into it."
"1381","Sometimes you have to remind yourself reddit is full of 19 year olds who have no idea what they are on about."
"1382","Coding is not my life. Work is not my life. Sure - if you love it go ahead and do it in free time.. nothing wrong with that. I don't do that. I enjoy going to the gym. I enjoy hiking. I enjoy swimming in the lake. I enjoy nice restaurants. So you can be sure that when I get home.. work stays at work. And so does coding."
"1383","I agree, and I haven't done Leetcode or gone to code meetups.  One thing I might say though, is that many people who go into computer science or software development actually enjoy it - which means sometimes, some of us sometimes like to work on our own programming projects *as a hobby* outside of work.  But it doesn't mean you should exclude everything else out of your life.  Personally, I have other hobbies &amp; things I like to do outside of work, but sometimes I have an idea for a software/programming project I'd like to work on.  I've been working as a software engineer since 2003 and I still occasionally have ideas for small software projects I'd like to work on in my free time.

I've even seen some job postings where they like to see any personal side projects you've worked on in your free time because you enjoy it.  That helps to show what you're passionate about."
"1384","Well I can only speak from personal experience, but some of us have an underdog complex and don't have the pedigree of some college graduates. I grind because I want to reach for the apex of my career and never have to worry about job security. I grew up in Detroit, where I have seen a sprawling american metropolis collapse into dust all within the span of 4 years of High school. I don't take anything for granted and I grind to be the best."
"1385","You dont need to grind Leetcode unless you are looking for a job at specific companies. If you are happy with your job and work life balance, theres nothing to worry about. This sub is mostly filled with people with time on their hands or those in college/looking for a job."
"1386","You know I've been only working for a couple months at this FAANG company and I thought everyone would be grinding grinding grinding. However, literally they don't do anymore coding outside of work. They enjoy life and maybe code a LITTLE bit on the weekends for their side projects. Some do LC but maybe like an hour or two a week is the max they say. They don't care that much because there's more to life then just working and work. Realistically a lot of people enjoy life and this sub is the echo chamber of grind and grind. Which works well(ish) when you're looking for a job (I did the same grind study plan). However, once you're working a 9-5 in tech there's no fucking way I'm literally gonna go home and be like WOW I really wanna do more coding. You need that reset button to keep you going in this long term game. That's what the senior dev's told me when I was getting a little worried even when I just started."
"1387","As long as you're not writing shit code other people will have to bang their head against later on we're all good brother

If you're one of those coders that push out shit code just to get stuff done and get paid then fuck you

Code lives on a lot longer than we'd all like, and working on a shitty codebase is so fucking depressing

At least my coworkers are very good at their job and I love learning from them

People who don't give a fuck, don't want to learn anything and don't want to teach are the fucking worst

Being a proper developer is definitely not a one stop shop thing like working at McDonald's where you'll learn everything you need to know in a few hours"
"1388","Yeah man this sub is filled with a bunch of weirdos which is why Ive never really taken stuff here serious lol. Im still in school right now and Ill be graduating in June but Im already working as a part time software engineer and itll become full time once I graduate. The only time Ive done leetcode was when I was applying to FAANGs but even then I wasnt obsessed over it like my life depended on it. Ive never any internships or side projects and idk even where tf to find a meetup. I essentially fucked around in school and partied hard lmao but I had an amazing college experience socially and academically which is what honestly matters the most because youre young once. Im one of the two persons in tech in my social group and we dont talk about tech like its the only thing in our life. I dont think about cs/coding outside of work or school and Im still living a great life. I mean Ill be making more than my siblings and parents combined so I guess I turned out alright."
"1389","No, you should not be worried.  Leetcode is a great resource for interviews and to get you sharp for a situation where you can be asked any technical question in any context.  That doesn't do much to make you good at your job, it makes you good at interviewing and solving new clever problems.  Meetups and other industry events are nice to haves and can help with networking (also mostly beneficial for interviewing and job searches) as well as giving you new ideas for your job but aren't necessary.  The only reason to worry is if you start to lose the ability to do software related tasks outside of what you do at work because you ""overfit"" to your daily tasks."
"1390","Dude the majority of people here are in school still.  If you have a job already, youre set.  When you move jobs in a few years, I almost guarantee they wont ask you any leetcode questions outside of basic data structures questions to make sure you arent lying on your resume.  

Asked both my managers of 20+ years experience and they both agreed after a few years of actually building stuff in a team, no one cares if you can pull an o(1) solution for a hard graph problem off the top of your head lmfao"
"1391","You will be able to answer this question for yourself once you start to look for a new job one of these days.  Either you find one fairly easy or wonder why you are not getting offers and start to try to get an edge by doing LC and other things."
"1392","A lot of people are doing leetcode and stuff at work.  I did at my last job."
"1393","A lot of people suffer with this, but the reality is that you should only get into the industry if programming is your passion and your willing to spend the time.

If you aren't having fun programming I would recommend that you take the hobby that your working on now and turn it into a career.

If you do that.. I guarantee you will be happy."
"1394","Just a little advice. If you and I are talking at work and I say, ""Wow. That's not right"", there's a good chance that you'll hear my tone, see my body language, and start to laugh along with me.

If you only see, ""Wow. That's not right"", it always comes of humorless and negative. This is an aspect of writing, not intent. So even if this sub were not a negative mind hive of self-perpetuating pubescent squawks and burned out wailing, it would still sound that way when you read it.

Go forth and stay happy. Your career is yours and yours alone. Comparison is the thief of happiness."
"1395","Maybe some people want to make a lot of money by doing leetcodes and getting a crazy job"
"1396","I mean if you want to be a 10xer you can grind in the off hours practicing and learning as much as you can, working on your skill like an athlete. If you just want to take it easy and collect a reasonably high salary with pretty good job security you can do that too. You get out what you put in, its up to you"
"1397","This sub is filled with highschool.idiots"
"1398","Never did leetcode and never got a college education. Recently got an entry position with decent pay and good opportunity to learn. Ive considered going back to school to improve my math.

You dont need leetcode"
"1399","I don't read this sub but I do follow it so it pops up on my feed once in a while. I have been coding 26 years, a product of the 90's and early internet. I have watched the digital change throughout the decades. The reason I code today is not the same reason I coded back then. Back then technology was freedom, you could easily be self employed and have plenty of clients. Today it's much more difficult because of the maturity of WYSIWYG editors and the sheer number of ""coders"" that are available, not to mention outsourcing all around the world. 

Back then I pursued knowledge of technology obsessively, coding 30 hours straight with the exception of naps. Often I would get back up sit at my desk and pick up the same cup of cold coffee right where I left it a couple of hours before without even looking at the cup. Code was life. Did I miss out on a lot? Yes I did but I also gained significant skill. 

Toxic culture exists in the workplace period. The issue with technology is that most people don't understand it and that creates complicating factors. Businesses only care about the bottom line so when they make a decision it is based on the hours and number of bodies they are throwing out something. This tends to breed technical debt which compounds future projects. 

Why do I code today? I have been doing it so long I can pick up news technologies easily. The logic and patterns are ingrained in my brain but it's also malleable to stay up to date. So coding today is very easy after all that time. I also get paid assloads of money to do a job that's not that difficult for me. If anyone gives me shit and it's unwarranted though I push back. 

If you are just starting out my suggestion is that you should get some more experience working with skilled people and then start your own company. Try until you succeed it may take 5, 10, 20 different tries. You will be much better off in the long run."
"1400","I think of leetcoding as enjoyment..."
"1401","&gt; Should I be worried about my future?

Read the signals at work. Is your team hiring? Is the company doing well this quarter? Are senior managers leaving unexpectedly? Is management constantly raising funds to meet commitments they've already made?

In my case, I accepted a job in another state not realizing that virtually the entire full time employee team left, except for one person who got promoted into management basically by default. Another warning sign was a senior (semi-retired) manager discussing the fundraising hole roughly the size of my salary. If that doesn't sound like you, that's great! Take a deep breath and relax buddy!

&gt; How do you guys handle the pressure that you get here?

If the pressure is bad for you now, consider what happens after job loss. I discovered this sub while job hunting. I'd been laid off from the non-profit I was working at, and decided to break into the 'for profit' world. I knew about CTCI from my tenure at the other side of the interview table grilling undergrads for campus jobs, but this sub gushed about LC.

&gt; I don't see the point in grinding programming problems for several hours or excluding everything out of my life except CS. How do you guys handle the pressure that you get here?

So except in extraordinary circumstances, you shouldn't bother grinding programming problems or skipping trivia night. I never did more than an hour of LC a day. The purpose was to brush up on python3, which I thought works quite well as a whiteboarding language. Realistically, I didn't change my life that much during the job search. What really changed was what I did during working hours. I generally spent an hour every day on the following tasks:

0. Interviews as scheduled  
1. Select a job opening, write a custom cover letter and apply  
2. A single Leetcode problem (sorted by difficulty)  
3. Find one or two new companies and new roles to apply to, and add it to The Spreadsheet  
4. Read a journal article or book chapter on a technical subject  
5. Watch a conference video  
6. Work on a project  

That about covered the work day, and left me with nights and weekends as usual. I did get out to more meetups, but lemme tell you that is more of a mental relief after 8 hours of 'working' from home.

These days I do maybe one LC a week, on the clock. Because most of my day is spent reading other people's YAML file changes and yelling at devs to  fix their bugs that took down production, I need a small, focused task to work on to keep my skills ready. And if the network goons report back that I'm LC'ing at work, so much the better. Best to keep management on their toes \^_^"
"1402","Honestly, I only code projects and not leetcode becuase I would like to get better coding.... plus it challenges me to think about new things, new ways of approaching and new apis etc etc.... Plus I live in an area where there is not much tech so I want to build my own app to sell....and this does not mean I have a life either...."
"1403","You only live once, so just do what makes you happy."
"1404","I did several interviews, had no coding whiteboard interviews and got a job as machine learning engineer half a year before graduating with a BS in cs. This forum is nonsense and only applicable to people wanting a job in silicone valley. Ignore people who go on about leetcode. Its mostly a waste of time as those problems are really only useful in interviews that ask leetcode questions. Its not always the way companies decide who theyre hiring..

I got my job because of my GPA, internship experience, and how I spoke during the interview."
"1405","It sounds a lot like showing off for me, tbh. You don't need to gear yourself up for leetcode questions and you have a normal life, while others dig their heads into the questions, and getting anxious abt missing one leetcode solution at interviews. And when you say you don't see the point of devoting completely in CS -- hey, when it comes from someone having their dream job already, and that you didn't need to go through the pain of leetcode and all, and describing others' effort like that, it just sounds condescending.

No leetcode and getting your dream job; only code for work and have a life outside -- perfect balance of being an expert at work, and expert in life ---- I don't know what there is to complain about. Or you're not complaining you just want to share the joy, idk."
"1406","Maybe the problem with all these desperate leetcoders trying to land that 'dream job' is the lack of life balance. Maybe if ya'll learned to lead a more balanced life even as you're leetcoding and preparing for the interviews you'd relax some and not fuck it up as a nervous wreck on interview day."
"1407","You have lazy programmers and ambitious programmers. Software development is both a path to get a good base salary and a path to high salary and notability. I am a lazy programmer. Don't get me wrong, I am not slacking at work, but I usually just want to put in the 7.5 hours work (8h - 2*15 paid breaks).

I go to the tech event every month. It is a free beer and as a quiet extrovert the forced interactions are great for me."
"1408","The fact that you go to a tech event every month is proof you aren't a 'lazy' programmer. You are putting in that little bit extra. I also am not the super-ambitious type that lives and breaths machine instructions 24/7, but I do read programming topics, go to programming meetups every month. The way I look at it is trying to 'level up' certain skills that I know are important to my career development, but not any more than that. I am not going to stop reading some biography or history to read another programming book."
"1409","I work for a FAANG. I only used leetcode a week before my interview for 2 of the FAANG (F and G) and passed both. None of my co workers used leetcode like people do in this sub. I feel like people here are approaching this the wrong way."
"1410","I ignore it, it's a bubble.

I have 2 kids under 4 and am as of about 10 weeks ago a single parent. I'm an experienced Python developer. I work a bog standard 8 hour day, but after that my time is for my kids. I love what I do, but my life is more than code."
"1411","Just chiming in to say you're not alone. A job is a job and passion is a passion. If you're passionate about programming and computer science then sure, knock yourself out. But if you're like me, who's studying this solely for the purpose of a better, quality life (so basically a tad bit of ""survival of the fittest"" thinking) and your passion lies elsewhere, don't feel pressured by these trains of thought. Be smart about it in order to make yourself happy and those around you."
"1412","The amount of outside project people suggest are nightmarish. Apparently some companies/hiring manager expect you to live and breath code like a robot"
"1413","Don't use Reddit overall as an indication of what normal people do. Reddit is very much so a place where over-the-top nerds congregate and will super confuse you on what life for normal people is like. 

Most of the advice here only really applies if you're trying for your first job at a big n. Otherwise you just make sure you know how to talk, and can handle normal programming questions that are relevant to the job you have to do. 

In most real-life situations, you're not really going to have to name the perfect algorithm off of the top of your head or any of the other nuts stuff people talk about on here. Most languages have a standard library with perfectly good versions of these data structures / algorithms. You just have to pick what you want to use based on the situation.

Even with the side projects: you shouldn't necessarily have to do a bunch of side stuff outside of work unless you're trying to make a stretch for your next job and you want to demonstrate your skills for potential employers or you want to improve your skills personally. 

There are jobs outside of Google and Facebook."
"1414","I wouldnt stop reading this stuff. But you dont need to spend time doing any of that leetcode or extra programming curricular stuff except if you want to find a new job, I think."
"1415","I disagree with those who say leetcode doesnt matter and spreading false expectations. In a world where children as young as in elementary school are being taught how to code, if you dont practice leetcode or whatever coding platform thats in fashion, they will. The bar is higher than ever before even for entry level positions, and it will keep getting higher as a lot of the hiring process continues to get automated away by AI. 

You have a very good reason to be scared if dont invest time to keep up with the trend in order to survive in this industry."
"1416","I learned in college I didnt want to do coding as a job, got into IT, sysadmin, now cyber security. Still wouldnt take back that CS education, still knowing the basics about code and how computers work is foundational. Seeing the code level of stuff that make the bigger things work. Writing code? No I learned in college after many all nighters of debugging....... Im not doing this 40-60 hours a week. Wasnt a natural either. I do plan on starting python beginner stuff this year and want to be good at that even if its not relevant to my job. Java, C, C++ was what I started with in school. Java was the main for the CS program. If thats also your path, start studying for those relevant certifications jobs ask for."
"1417","&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  I never opened Leetcode in my browser, never went to a meetup and I only code at work. And you know what? I'm super happy with that because I have a normal life outside of work and I can pursue great hobbys where coding is not a part of.  

After graduation, I worked at one place for 4 years. While working there, I was happy, outside the work I was enjoying life. I never went to any meetup neither bother to learn anything new outside of the work. While at work I learn Perl , C++ and did C programming. After 4 years due to restructuring my position got terminated.  

When I was looking for work, one thing I realized is I didn't had 4 year experience but 1 year + 3 x 1year = 2 years only. I didn't learn anything new that can help me find the job. This was eye opening for me. After that I start reading book and start going to meet up. This help me build network and learn new ideas. See how others are doing.  I always think this way if my position is terminated today. Will I able to demonstrate new skills? You might not want to learn how to solve leetcode problems. But you do want to advance your programming skills."
"1418","I have fifteen years of experience in this field. This kind of padding is more necessary if you aren't finding jobs that stretch your abilities and give you something interesting to learn. I consider learning on the job to be part of my compensation, and am earning somewhat above market for my location, role, and experience. 

Do this kind of work outside of your job when you stop learning on the job long-term, if you feel like it, or if you perceive a shortage of opportunities and want to fix that. Interview annually to keep your interviewing skills up and to assure yourself that your skills are in demand, if you have energy. But as long as you are happy with your opportunities and are growing, you are probably fine."
"1419","Most of the CS world doesnt browse here. If they did, many of us would feel like shit for not matching up to the Masters Degree with concentration in AI, intern at Google and Bill Gates personal fluffer making 230k @ age 24 type people you see posting here

Most of us are like you, we do our job then come home and do other things.

I wish more CS people would try govt or contracting cleared jobs. A TS clearance takes a little over a year to get and you can hit 130k within 3 years easy without any coding tests."
"1420","You're just a normal person, don't worry. CS doesn't need to encompass your life. Years of experience is enough to get you into a lot of jobs and probably will continue to do so for a long time. Most people who code aren't as good as they think they are and good engineers are always going to be in a shortage."
"1421","I think some people are more passionate than others. Theres nothing wrong with that but the advice that leetcode is a must for hours daily is not accurate but merely projection. 

Depending on ones goal to work for certain companies, that may be necessary for a short period  of time in preparation for an interview. And maybe brushing up on skills but to do it everyday? 

If you have to keep leetcoding, something is wrong. Sure practice is fine but if you dont  master the basic concepts let alone truly understand them, then theres the problem. 


Let them do what they want. Its their problem how they want to use their remainder time left on this planet.

Theres a reason that theres only 2.6k billionaires out of a 7 billion+ population worldwide and it isnt leetcode. 

In the grand scheme of things, many fail to see the purpose of life or get carried away in so many things. I saw the same thing in high school and college. People stressing themselves to get an A+ so much that they forget the purpose of learning. Not to mention toiling their health in the process. 
They go crazy if they get an A or even A- thinking their life is over. 

One dude actually had a lot of gray hair from stress. They memorize, binge and forget instead of learning and applying. In the end, those people didnt even go to any Ivy Leagues. Sadly, Im seeing the same mentality here and in other areas of life. This is more common but not exclusive to first world countries. Regardless of the school or job you have, the road ends the same. 

People have had strokes or even dropped dead from work related stress. Same thing with the gym. Take it from me as a warning. Ive seen this in my personal life. You cant buy your health back. Ask many of the wealthy men who were on their deathbed. 

Theres a time for everything and knowing the balance is key. This is not solely applicable for work but for life in general.

Work smart, not hard. 

My advice to you? Take the advice here with consideration but also with a grain of salt. Ask people in real life in your industry to confirm said advice or receive relative advice in your stage of life."
"1422","What's wrong with going to the gym?"
"1423","Why do we get these posts every 3 days?"
"1424","I don't view the success stories of others as personal indictments to my own self worth. Instead, I choose to be inspired by them.

They applied for how many jobs? They continued preparing for technical interviews after how many rejections??

Ultimately, people are just posting information. How your process that information is completely up to you."
"1425","Why are you even here if youre satisfied with your career?"
"1426","To help other people perhaps? If it was just people without jobs helping other people without jobs, this would be a pretty shit place to go to get questions answered, right?"
"1427","TC?"
"1428","Total compensation"
"1429","Counter strike career questions.... Sounds like a cool sub"
"1430","Software engineering is a commodity now. There will always be work for you. How much you want to get paid will depends on what you do outside of a job."
"1431","Commodity? What percentage of the population knows how to code? I dont think this is anywhere near a commodity."
"1432","Yeah but whats your TC...

As for being able to handle the pressure. I don't feel any pressure I genuinely love programming/math and it is not a chore for me to read random books about Rust, for example, or do programming challenges for fun."
"1433","What is TC?"
"1434","Total Compensation"
"1435","Total Compensation"
"1436","Lol you leetcode for just a few weeks and you have way more free time in life because you make way more money at FANG and can retire earlier / afford to take long vacations and nice trips"
