"1","[I like to view DS as a venn diagram](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ju4m6PBOrgo/V-E5qz99SaI/AAAAAAAAMF0/gle0zsZz_nIBEMVg0EdZHoGJhjlnBzv1gCLcB/s1600/moz-screenshot-3-729576.png)  
  
To really be a great data scientist, you need expertise in these 3 areas. If you have domain experience and programming/database but lack the math/statistics, then theres not any useful analysis you can do. This would be a software engineer/developer. If you have domain experience and math/statistics but lack the programming/databases experience, then youre more of a traditional statistician or data analyst. Finally, if you have the math/statistics and programming/database experience without the domain knowledge, then you know enough to be dangerous, but youll have a hard time knowing what questions to ask and how to go about answering questions in certain domains.   
  
Now most of the things you listed out fall into the stats/math. One thing I want to point out is you're typing out different machine learning algorithms which isn't necessarily a ""skill"". It would be more accurate if you listed out the category of machine learning algorithms instead and what they're accomplishing. Example -  
  
Machine learning - supervised learning  
Machine learning - unsupervised learning  
Machine learning - NLP 
Machine learning - Deep Learning/NN  
  
You would be better off becoming an ""expert"" in one of these areas instead of trying to be an expert in them all. For example, I would say I'm an expert in supervised learning. I haven't really done too much unsupervised learning, NLP or deep learning/NN and the main reason is because I haven't really had the need too. Now keep in mind that I still know what each of these categories are doing and I stay up to date on the relevant algorithms/techniques.  
  
Then circling back to the venn diagram, you'll have a hard time implementing these algorithms if you don't know programming and you'll have a hard time coming up with Hypothesis or A/B testing without the domain experience. 
  
I would recommend that most noobies/beginners start with supervised learning as its the easiest to get started with and easiest to validate. Once you understand how machine learning works, the goal and the basics then it's easier to start moving into the other categories."
"2","Great. I lack domain knowledge and I'm not sure how to gain it without actualy working in the industry. Then there are requirements given in job ads or interviews. For example time series keeps coming up and it's a topic I personally like as well.

Still ""supervised learning"" is a huge subject. For example I heard about Gaussian process regression just a few days ago from an employer.

&amp;#x200B;

Ironically my scientific research uses mostly unsupervised learning (clustering) but SL methods come up much more in job ads."
"3","The amount of domain knowledge needed is dependent on the domain. For example, if you're doing data science at an e-commerce company, it shouldn't be too hard to learn that domain knowledge compared to something like biology/healthcare. IMO the important part here is getting a job in a domain that you actually enjoy.  
  
&gt; Still ""supervised learning"" is a huge subject. For example I heard about Gaussian process regression just a few days ago from an employer.  
  
Agreed. When I started, my mentor told me to pick an algorithm and become an expert in it. I went with gradient boosting because it was the most popular and one of the best algorithms for handling tabular data (which it still is). Starting with a complex model like gradient boosting made it easier for me to learn other less complex models. I use gradient boosting (LightGBM package to be exact) for almost every model I build. It works great and there is good packages for determining things like feature importance so you can gain insight into how the model is making decisions compared to a black box model.  
  
I've done unsupervised a couple times and that was really more for exploratory analysis purposes where were trying to see if there is certain segments in the data. I also used this for an RFM analysis once and it worked well.  
  
For me, in the beginning I mainly stuck to topics that I could apply at my job which helped because I could implement them on real data. I'm actually working on a book idea that will give a learning path for beginners and then another book for going from junior developer to mid/senior level. I'll keep you posted on that."
"4","Great advice. In terms of topic I like time series most, and they are very useful too. But in terms of an algorithm, I'm not sure yet. (ARIMA is becoming old school!)  GB is very interesting for sure...and so are RNNs. And sure, please keep me posted on your books."
"5","The problem with an unranked list is that it makes each item seem equally important, and/or that the effort to learn (or ""master"") them is equivalent. They are not. 

Any new-grad stats PhD out of school probably has exposure to every single item on that list, and probably has ""mastered"" 70% of those, if by mastery you mean know it better than say 80% of data scientists/analysts. The only things they probably don't have much exposure in that list might be SQL and productionization. Beyond a certain point, there are common threads. 

However, that doesn't necessarily make them the perfect data scientists. You don't really need mastery of everything to be effective. You need to know how to drive business value to be effective, you need to know how to work effectively in an organization, etc. 

So stop worrying about how everything here relates, or if there's an ""optimal"" subset that you should learn. Learn what you want or need for what you're doing right now. Get an entry-level role/internship in the field, or otherwise get exposure to what data analysts/scientists do their job, and over time you'll figure out what's important, and figure out what level of ""mastery"" you actually need for each. These vary a lot by industry, role, and region."
"6","Yeah that must be why corporates want candidates with industry experience. I feel I'm too old for an internship but I just applied for a postdoc position that involves using ML for an engineering project."
"7","So knowledge of data frames, linear/logistic regression, and hypothesis testing are essential.  All the other things?  Who cares?  Write decent code.  Know applied statistics."
"8","I would have to do a factor analysis to figure that out. =D"
"9","/r/DataScience"
"10","Your IB skills with Excel will translate well for most analytics roles. You've already been working in analytics and simply have to upgrade your toolkit. My recommendation is to focus on the pandas library of Python to replicate work you would do in Excel. (Vlookup to pd.merge, selecting columns and rows, pivot table to groupby and pivot_table).

A large amount of not majority of data scientist roles are analytics type roles."

Classic research / IO PhD -&gt; R

Methods / more complicated Research / big data / ... -&gt; Python

But a bit of everything might be a great start. Don't forget to enjoy your life though :)"
"13","I think a little more of a dive into excel would be valuable (vlookups, if statements). Whether you like it or not youre almost always going to have to work with excel even though your data cleaning should almost always be in R/Python. As you mentioned basic SQL is valuable.

Some kind of viz tool (tableau, google data studio,etc.). Most schools offer a free version of at least one of the major visualizations tools. 

Also regarding R/Python - most shops Ive spoken to use R  but Id say getting a sample survey data set and running some of the different analyses (regression,t-tests, cluster analysis) you learn in school will be valuable. Have to be careful about you how you about learning it because a lot of the online classes dont use HR datasets so Id recommend practicing on one of those from the jump. 

Also, these are all company/industry specific. I know some people in finance that have never used SQL but its definitely a good tool to have. 

Feel free to message me if you have any other questions Ive trained multiple interns, workforce analysts on developing these skills."
"14","Learning to write functions for data cleaning and quick exploratory analysis in Python using pandas has saved me tons of time I would have wasted in Excel. Though you can probably do that in R as well. But I dont use R.

Also, learning how to utilize APIs and web scraping might be useful depending on your job."
"15","Thank you! Are there any specific functions on data cleaning youd recommend?"
"16","Its hard to name anything specific because there are so many and it rlly depends on your needs. I usually write my own functions with the built in methods pandas offers so I would just recommend a tutorial on pandas.

But heres a cheat sheet from data camp I find myself referring to a lot: 

http://datacamp-community-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/dbed353d-2757-4617-8206-8767ab379ab3"
"17","In R, you should learn basic data structures, data types, indexing, filtering, vectorization, control structures, and the apply family."
"18","In addition to what everyone has mentioned here I want to mention the little known but super powerful data tool of a good word processor. I prefer Sublime Text but many will use Notepad++. There are so many uses for programs like these when analyzing data. 

1. You can use them as a code check (you tell it what kind of code you are writing and it does highlighting).

2. You can do powerful find/replace commands. I have taken rows of Excel strings that I want to convert into a comma list for use in R that take seconds to format in Sublime. Find and replace ""\n"" "", "" to turn every new line entry into a comma separated list that can be copied and pasted into R/Python.

3. Ctrl+Shift+K otherwise known as multiple selections. You can edit in more than one place at once. It works as a quick substitute for find and replace, or to apply the same sequence of changes to multiple lines simultaneously. Basically, let's say you want to add the same text to 40 lines of code but in different places. You can multiple select all the places you want something then type it out and it appears in every selection space.

4. It doesn't use those damn fake quotation makes like Word does. So you can copy and paste into terminals, programs, etc. without worry that it will give you an error since Word uses non-utf-8 quotation marks.

5. Tabs. 

6. Save on exit. 

7. Looks cool. 

8. You can brag to the other nerds around the water cooler about some new hotkey you learned."
"19","Good advice. I write pretty much everything in np++. I love how it saves my stuff even if my battery dies. I never charge my laptop at home, so I often sit down, dock my machine, and realize it died."
"20","Got laughed the other day by a ""data scientist"" consultant... he was trying to tell me that the more people paid for a service, they were more loyal to it because they saw more value in it.. they measured it by churn. I asked how we didn't know it wasn't the other way around, that consumers who were less likely to churn also were willing to pay more, and that as you raised price you scared away more churn-likely consumers.. a few blanks stares later and it devolved into me explaining to the fellow the whole causation vs correlation fallacy in statistics."
"21","You had me at consultant"
"22","[deleted]"
"23","There tends to be an inverse relationship between the size of a consultant's paycheck and the value they generate... so yes, they're probably making good money."
"24","This has to be why I failed as a consultant. I just could not sell people on our data that would never do what they wanted it to."
"25","Honesty is often times at odds with profit.

Hell, having known a lot of hustlers making a good living through questionable channels and activities, I almost wanted to say honesty is actively forbidding people from becoming wealthy."
"26","For ""profit"" defined broadly enough to include political power-building of mid-level managers looking to make a name for themselves."
"27","Yeah, any sort of personal gain, really."
"28","Generally no, but its consulting company for sure."
"29","I laughed out loud at this comment. I would give you gold if I had money. Lmao."
"30","Yea, it annoys the hell out of me because I am a consultant and I actually have a mathematics and STEM background (chemistry and biology), and these jokesters come along with their few coursera classes claiming to be knowledgeable.

Or my wife who is a data scientist and has a masters in statistics and operations research. The team's she is on is really good, but when she has to work with contractors, they encounter some like that. It's just like... How did you manage to get here?"
"31","I've decided the only people who put actual value on coursera (or website of choice) certs are people who have never done them. You can basically turn your brain off, half-ass it, then get the cert.

I'm of the opinion it's better to ask to see a few projects they've done. Even if they're just personal side projects, it's still better than some online certificate from courses of varying rigor and use."
"32","It's true that many days scientists aren't particularly knowledgeable about statistics. However, I've started to see more and more job postings for statistically literate people, especially people with knowledge of causal inference (what I believe to be the next hot thing in data science/analytics)."
"33","Then I hope that I am still on the right track with my MA in Economics and Data Science, as the topic of causal inference / stats plays a decisive role here. I always thought I would have to add a second Master in CS to be employable in DS at all. :)"
"34","Econometrics (well Econ as a whole as well) and Data Science are so well-poised to come together... Look up Susan Athey. CS is a great skill of course, Python and maybe some R development knowledge (not just DS) will make life a lot easier. :)"

"36","Thank you very much for your recommendation! This is precisely the research that I think will establish itself in the field of economics over the next few years."
"37","Judea Pearl would agree with your opinion. He wrote a whole book on that issue."
"38","Yes, Pearl and his do-calculus is one of the theoretical frameworks related to causal inference. The NeymanRubinHolland model with potential outcomes is another. Moreover, at my old university they were studying some sort of hybrid framework that would combine graphs and potential outcomes via so-called ""node splitting""."
"39","I got very interested on this, do you know the name of the researchers or could you at least give me the name of the university so I can look into it? (For the node splitting part)"
"40","Sorry, I graduated years ago and that work was done by my professors in recently started research projects, so I don't know if anything has been published yet. However, it seems like others are trying to combine causal graphs with potential outcomessee for instance: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331670633_A_Potential_Outcomes_Calculus_for_Identifying_Conditional_Path-Specific_Effects.

More specifically, node splitting is at least discussed here, but I can't say if their approach is similar: https://youtu.be/NpNTfvbE1gY."
"41","Thomas Richardson and Jamie Robins, Single World Intervention Graphs. Theres probably some YouTube videos on it."
"42","Have worked with a guy who got in the top 5% in multiple Kaggle competitions. He was self-taught, haven't heard about t-test, and had very vague ideas about causation. Still helped us to develop a complex data pipeline, designed a couple of models still used in production, and finally got poached by a competitor.

In my experience, having a good statistical foundation helps, but it is not mandatory, especially if your task is to provide predictions, not inferences."
"43","Honestly I think this entire discussion is about prediction vs inference. As you said, statistical background isnt a total necessity when tasks only consist of prediction. Who cares about q-q plots when all thats being built is black box models?"
"44","I guess the issue arises when management/outsiders start to conflate prediction with inference. I recently helped out with a clinical research project where the the lab interpreted lasso selection as an oracle for finding the true ""important"" predictors. It was difficult to explain to them the lack of any statistical guarantees of the variable selection, especially given that we had *p &gt; n*.

I've heard many data scientists say that communicating the results is a huge part of the job, and I think it's at least important to be able to address the inferential limitations of predictive black box models."
"45","Check out some papers by Chernozhukov and Belloni on Lasso. They show that in a p&gt;n setting you can get causal inference by doing something called double-selection in Lasso."
"46","And isn't anything above linear/logistic regression essential a black box? 
It's my opinion that if you need a complex model be it tree based or deep learning, then your data simply is very complex and you can't make any simple conclusions from it that you can directly implement in real-world."
"47","And this is why in bioinformatics (and biology in general), we always have to go validate our results in the lab. The discussion is always, ""Yeah, cool, so you found 10 major driver genes... Did any of them actually work though?""

It's a pretty interesting debate we have, because sometimes good statistics just doesn't work in the lab, whereas some, not *bad*, but, less than ideal, statistics finds ""real"" hits."
"48","Forgive my ignorance but isn't inference important when doing predictions? I'd love to hear where this breaks down as I'm not knowledgable enough about statistics."
"49","To my understanding... The difference is the *focus*.

Inference is more concerned with the ""why"" and digging into the relationships between things.

Like finding the extent to which age affects the probability of someone not defaulting on a loan.

Inference is useful for decision support. Like... ""Variable A is the main reason why we lose customers. So let's target that to reduce churn"".

Whereas prediction is a ""proof is in the pudding"" focus. Even though prediction is built upon inferential statistics.

So the focus would be in accurately predicting who will default on loans rather than the ""why"" behind each particular variable.

However... with the credibility and explainability crisis I expect that a greater focus will be on the why questions in the near future. More and more regulation will be in place forcing data scientists to explain how and why their algorithm made its decision. 

So I think in the future, the simple and models with explainable outcomes will tend to triumph for most business use cases. Those algorithms will stand up to audits and would facilitate things like a customers right to know why they were denied a loan.

This may not be a 100% accurate explanation, but according to Cunninghams Law... if its not then we will know soon."
"50","As you said, often times the two are intertwined, interpretibility is huge area of research for a reason. You need to explain why you made a prediction, and inherent to that is some implicit causality.

I don't think it means that nn and tree models are going away, but understanding how to interpret models correctly is part of the prediction skill set imo."
"51","I suppose this is exactly why DS folks shouldn't de-emphasize inferential statistics."

"56","I'm a PhD in the biosciences trying to learn data science as well; so I'm curious too :)"
"57","It can matter if you want to know the best levers you need to pull to improve the prediction (in context of the model).

E.g. -- deciding compensation for hiring one more sales persons with background knowledge X results in Y sales."
"58","The thing is, data science is a broad field. Those who have all the skills are extremely rare. The best thing is to get a team that has all the skills and have them work together."
"59","I agree. We also have someone like that and he developed end to end solutions and delivered it to the customers beautifully. A large tech company in SFO area poached him. This person had a very basic stats understanding."
"60","I think it's about the right domain.

Prediction is *wonderful* if fundamental things about the world don't change. Marketing response prediction works great until bad press hits (e.g. Wells Fargo). It's enormously difficult to pivot from reduced form models (typical builds for prediction) to structural models needed to disentangle deep parameters -- and even those aren't fool proof!"
"61","This discussion is as old as data science and it's very close to discussions in CS about 'real programmers'. I will tell you something as someone, who worked in data science for several years: statistical theory in data science is pretty overrated. It's not that you don't need it, but what you describe is not a lack of understanding math, it's a lack of common sense and domain understanding. 

Data Science at the university is research oriented and in the industry it's pretty rare, that you are able to dive deep into methodologies. Usually understanding your domain is much more important. Furthermore, visualization and storytelling are the most important skills as a data scientist in advanced analytics. The truth is, that data science is not different to other roles. In the end it does not matter if much if your findings are 100% correct as long, they look impressive to your stakeholders and just work. 

When we look at predictive analytics, it gets even more interesting. People build models, which predict the cause of a feature or include data leakage and promote the huge accuracy model as breakthrough, without being skeptical. You dont need a deep understanding of stats, to understand that it does not give you much benefit to use these predictions. In the end the model will just not work.

The good thing is, all these wrong assuptions and results are usually discovered later on (A/B tests, KPIs, whatever) and you learn from it. I doubt that statistical theory helps you to avoid all these mistakes in a **time-efficient** way."
"62","&gt;but what you describe is not a lack of understanding math, it's a lack of common sense and domain understanding.

In a way, this sub was the reason I put my plan of a masters data science in the back burner because I wanted to focus on stats more. But when you put it this way, I guess I'm being foolish to wait until I'm completely ready to be data scientist.

I guess, eventually, all niche skills will evolve enough that you won't need in-depth understanding to be in that profession. You don't have to know formal languages to be an IT Admin, or you don't have to have a masters in finance to use an accounting software."

"76","You're missing something fundamental here. If people were just looking for a simple answer to a question then very likely they would Google the question and get the answer. in the context of Reddit that means they would search the Reddit threads and get the answer

However, in this and many other subreddits people are looking to have a discussion. They're looking to explore the issue, discuss the complexities in general and perhaps how it may relate to their specific situation.

You state that the discussion might not have any merit unless something new is brought to the table. how would you know if something new is brought to the table unless you have the discussion?

It's my experience that most often you do not find valuable, previously unknown ideas just coming out of the woodwork completely formed and ready to go. In my professional life these sorts of rare and valuable original solutions or perspectives come from discussion amongst peers and colleagues. How could we ever do that if we limited our topics to things that were not already discussed previously.

Ultimately, Reddit isn't stack exchange. It's a forum for discussion, a place that people talk about things. I talked about a lot of things before that doesn't necessarily mean that I don't enjoy or benefit from having a discussion with someone new."
"77","Considering how a significant portion of our community is people trying to break into the field, I think it's healthy to have a periodic reminder that statistical expertise needs to be a part of the professional expectations for the role. Further, I think the data science community is overdue to come up with new language to differentiate what we used to call a data scientist, and the ""data analyst *plus*"" qualification that has been lowering the bar."
"78","Yeah, unfortunately when people want to get perspectives on something on Reddit, their impulse is to post first rather than search first. 

(Or people *do* search first, read relevant comment threads, still want to make their own thread on the topic, but opt against referencing all the existing perspectives they've just read? Seems unlikely, but it is a possibility)"
"79","I can't remember where I read it, but it was basically the same thing you said.  It applied to 'big data.'  Basically, the gripe was that there was a lot of data, but the necessary assumptions about the data and analysis often aren't being examined leading to heavily biased results and spurious correlations. 

My problem with 'data science' in general is that there is no real definition of what constitutes a data scientist as opposed to a statistician.   This can be seen in the various curriculums being offered for data science and the job postings out there."
"80","I know what youre talking about, but dont forget that data science is extremely broad and somewhat ill defined. 

You appear to be talking more about inference than straight-up prediction, which can be two different animals. 

The thing I see missing from the data scientists I work with is the *science* part. Theyre great coders and they understand the math and the parts to get models to work, but they dont seem to grasp the scientific process, which is as important as the modeling."
"81","What are they missing in terms of scientific process though?"
"82","Websters Dictionary defines science as...lol just kidding. 

Science is the systematic study of a topic. To systematically study something you need to structure your ideas into hypotheses, formally test them, and document everything. Science is reproducible research. 

The teams Ive worked with dont do this. It is a foreign idea for them to document things that dont work or produce desired results (i.e., *negative results*). However, knowing what doesnt work is often as important as knowing what does work. 

It is an ongoing battle to get them to simply document everything they do, which makes replicating their results impossible.

"84","Causal inference is separate from predictive analytics. 

In predictive analytics you don't really care about what the coefficient mean, as long as it ""works."" Much more mathematical.

While causal inference relies more heavily on domain knowledge IMO and you ONLY care about the coeffiecients.

One is about Y_hat and the other is about beta_hat.

Also, at least for business data, adding in a ""few controls"" isn't any more robust. You need to control for **everything** to have causal inference, usually by some type of experimental design."
"85","&gt; While causal inference relies more heavily on domain knowledge IMO and you ONLY care about the coeffiecients.

Eh... sort of? Depends on the domain. Causal inference is closer to diff-in-diff, and isn't the only use for descriptive modeling.

E.g. credit risk scoring *requires* descriptive reasons for rejecting a credit score."
"86","I would argue diff and diff is causal inference, when experimenting is impossible.

I guess maybe moreso, arguing that you only care about some coefficients. In my econometrics class, our diff-in-diff was a regression coefficient."
"87","Yep! The techniques behind D-D aren't insane. An experiment is basically a D-D by its nature -- due to random assignment, the initial diff is approximately 0. D-D is definitely a *part* of causal inference, not the sum-total. Apologies for lacking clarity."
"88","One of the small number of ""most important# things I have learned in my 20s is that there are,very very very few people that actually know what they are doing. This goes for all ""experts"" across all fields.  It just seems to be this snowball effect of human nature where people to want to look up to someone as an expert, while at the same time people getting literally high from the praise.  What results is a bunch of people who think politicians, scientists, doctors, etc.. Are these anti-human superhero geniuses who are immune to criticism outside of their field.  And this happens on the micro level to.  Pretty much all of the typical heroes the MSM and school systems like to prop up were horribly flawed in reality.  

So ya. This obviously ia happening in ""data science"".  Theres too mich breadth and not enough depth.  I'm an expert in 1.5 things. Goalkeeping for sure and Food Service Operations in a general customer service operational standards sense. It took me being a literal genius and about a decade of experience in both to accomplish that.  Once you really know something well for the first time, you realize how hard it is to do and how few people have ever achieved this.  Probably 1 or 2 out of 100 ""data scientists"" really know what they are doing.  Probably a few more than that are experts in some subset of the field.

Specifically though, my Masters in Data Analytics from WGU focused quite a bit on statistics.  They didnt require you to memorize it, and I certainly didn't, but it exposed it the statistixs to me three different times in three different ways.  I know enough to know how much I dont know in the field, and what I would need to figure out to accomplish some sort of meaningful model. 

That all being said, the whole field is dangerous.  So many managers and users of this data don't want it done correctly.  They dont want to pay for the resources to produce something that, if done correctly, likely will tell them they might be on to something but probably need to spend more money to get a definitive answer if its possible at all.  They just want to be able to pretend to be using the new trend for vanity reasons, or they just want to pay someone to tell them how good of a job they are doing and how their current projects are supposed to result in better financial performance.. Regardless of the actual truth behind it.. Which is that in reality its almost impossible to do this with accuracy.  I say that meaning with how projects tend to be aligned.  Obviously in theory, and sometimws in practice, you can define the question narrow enough with solid enough underlying data to draw meaningful conclusions. Its just extremely rare."

"91","Originally ""data science"" in the industry became popular as a discipline for more predictive applications in which causal inference doesn't play a big role, and was previously dominated by classical statisticians using SAS. CS/Engineering folks got an edge by just using python, xgboost and modern development practices, especially in tech companies.

&amp;#x200B;

Following this success and all the buzz, corporations started to hire the same type of people to do all data stuff that was previously dominated by analysts using Excel (these guys are falling for these statistical fallacies for ages, the only difference is that their methods are shallow enough to management with some business feeling to call BS on them) - including applications where causal inference is central. Not only that, many corporations just started to rename whatever they called their Excel analysts with ""data scientists"" to attract employees.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, technological buzzwords won't solve causal inference - in fact they could lead to more BS vendors going undetected and I'm afraid that the movement in overall with harm more than benefit society in the short term."
"92","I think that there are many types of Data Scientists and many types of jobs/companies. In some places deep statistical analysis is necessary, in others it isn't required.

&amp;#x200B;

In essence this is a question: is data science/ machine learning a glorified statistics or not?

Or: is causal relationships or quality of predictions ? (as many people in this thread already said)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm biased and think that the quality of predictions is much more important for business.

* It is true that you could design a great experiment and make a study of variables, you could look for multicollinearity, run statistical tests and do other things. It would work and be really important in some cases. But if we talk about practice, it is much easier to train gradient boosting model, which doesn't require such assumptions as linear models.
* Sometimes people say that gradient boosting models are black boxes and can't be understood. I disagree - there a lot of tools and technics to do this like LIME, ELI5, SHAP, partial dependency plots and other things. Of course they don't reveal causal relationship between variables and target... but they show how changes in the variable will influence the target which is good enough.
* Also clever technics can replace old tools at least in terms of efficiency. For example it is important to check that the distribution of variables in training data is similar to their distribution in the new data. We could run statistical tests to compare distributions... or we could use adversarial validation.
* And all of this was about ""research"" stages of the projects. When we talk about putting models in production, it is much more important to write good code and pipeline, make a reproducible machine learning project. In companies with developed infrastructure the models would make predictions automatically, their performance would be monitored, if there are signs of model deterioration, then the models would be automatically retrained;
* Also I suppose this discussion is more relevant to classification and regression models. What about recommendation systems? Graph networks? Deep learning on texts and images?

Nevertheless I agree that it is necessary to have at least some knowledge of statistics and common sense. I saw cases when people made serious mistakes due to the lack of critical thinking. But this is more about critical thinking than statistics."
"93","I work with Data Science since 2015, this profile is very common unfortunately. When I started to work on Data Science it was on the field of Natural Language Processing and I have a really brief knowledge of statistics.

Now, after some years, I have more background on probability&amp;statistics theory, as I completed the course of Probability&amp;statistics and Stochastics Processes on the college (Computer Engineering course).

But even more common than that it's data scientist that cannot build software, but only jupyter notebooks. In my view is not a worse problem than not know anything of the theory behind, but well... programming in data science is a serious skill too.

As you said, there is more interesting in making the models seems pretty than correct in the analysis view, but I would said that remains the same at software engineering architecture.

For all that reason, I think building a culture behind Data Science is very important. This year I created a Project Template to help on that."
"94","As an aspiring data scientist, this is something I know I am lacking in.

What would you recommend someone like me, who is trying to improve their understanding of statistics, do? Are there any good online sources, or should I just grab a few books and drill down?"
"95","I'm gonna be frank with you: statistics is a difficult subject, and it takes some time and effort to learn it, so while there are some online sources to learn particular concepts, I really think that you would benefit from a book that offers a more structured approach to the topic.

Regarding a good book for learning some statistics, it depends to an extent on what field you want to work, but for the basics I think that it shouldn't make that much of a difference. It depends on what math background you have, but if it is low ( or non existent), I found the book ""Statistics for Business and Economics"" by Newbold et al quite easy and aprocheable when I took my first course in statistics, and it should include most basic topics of probability theory and some regression.

 In adittion, if you are interested in regression analysis you can't go wrong with introductory econometrics by Wooldridge, one of the most useful books I have ever used, quite comprehensive and easy"
"96","I'm a BS Economics student and Wooldridge is indeed a great book to learn linear regression and panel data (longitudinal for statisticians). For time series I think the best book would be Gujarati. For some reason I got some difficult with Wooldridge approach.

By the way, I took my econometrics classes almost a year ago, I remember the theory quite well, but the proves like how to get the estimation of the betas in linear regression using matrices approach is one example I don't remember. Do you think this is important to know or I'm good remember just theory?"
"97","Depends what you plan to do. If you wanna go into academia  is something quite important to know. If you are going to the private sector to a work that is mostly applied stats or econometrics tohugh, I don't think knowing proofs by heart is that valuable. Knowing the intuition of the concepts and what that proof is supossed to show should be more than enough (at least if you are not on a really technical position, but you need a PHD for those anyway)"
"98","Which Gujarati book are you referring to? Basic Econometrics?"
"99","Yes. That one."
"100","Personally , I would recommend  Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data
By Wooldridge. 

This a little more advanced text but it help to really understand the model . I find his introduction book not enough too understands the key concept and this book talk about other regression type than just OLS ."
"101","A second opinion, but if you're focused on predictive analytics and more ""CS"" applications of data science (NLP type stuff or deep learning), I don't think learning causal inferences is useful for you, beyond knowing what your models DON'T do."
"102","I've worked for 40 years now (not in data science), having graduated in Comp. Sci. in 1978, and agree with many of the comments here - especially that very few people really know what they're doing. Real experts understand that and tend to be the most modest people you will meet -- unlike bullshitters. As someone said, the more you know, the more you realise what you don't know.

A good data scientist really needs it all - excellent software development skills, good stats knowledge, good data skills, good inter-personal skills and domain expertise -- which is almost impossible.

I'd like to add something about programming. People who are not trained in software development generally write bad code. There are exceptions (both ways - I've seen Comp. Sci. graduates who can't program) but, generally, you can tell the educated programmer from the rest. Really good programming skills are often under-valued in debates about what makes a good data scientist."
"103","As a decent programmer, the recruiters have funneled me into a career as a data engineer, instead of data scientist.

These companies really believe a data scientist's programming skills don't need to be any greater than the ability to run scripts in Jupyter notebooks."
"104","They're wrong to think that. But, on the bright side, doing data engineering for a while will help you in the long run because you will gain insights into data science that the people who take shortcuts will never have."

Oh, I'd love to hear from the great to the worst. Could you share your experience please?"
"106","It jumps out of the code when you see a good (trained) and bad (untrained) programmer. There is an art and science of programming that is immediately apparent when you look at their code. It's relatively easy to get code to ""work"" but the elegance and efficiency (and maintainablity) of the code is something else. Also, untrained programmers really can't produce complex code. Their bad practices even confuse themselves when they try to do something clever with code."
"107","Hi. I noticed that you said that people not trained in software development generally write bad code. I am in my second year of an undergrad degree in Mathematics, so I'm not being taught software development in school. Do you have any recommendations as to how I can acquire good software development skills? Are there any textbooks or other resources that you have in mind?"
"108","Can you do a class in Comp. Sci.? A programming class, taught by a computer scientist? There is a science and art of programming that is really only appreciated by specialists. It's been so long since I studied computer programming that I don't know of any contemporary resources. But I would advise being taught by a specialist and not a self-taught person.

Many scientists (statisticians, physicists, etc.) are self-taught programmers and their coding skills are poor."
"109","I agree with you, most of the information I find focuses on the pipeline, but stays away from the stats. 

I'm not sure of the stats of hiring but I imagine that people who don't know what they are actually doing are not the average hire."
"110","I even work with someone who is like this.   
She makes really great figures, but she doesn't understand the machinery behind the algorithms she uses or how they should be interpreted.  
It's too easy to pick an algorithm, generate a pretty picture and use it justify your ends."
"111","I am really trying to know how would that work. Like any algorithm we pick must be based upon what we are trying to achieve. isn't it? 

For example:
So let's say there is a huge n available p is also small and we let's say don't have care about interpretation of data but just want to predict an outcome. 

Now in that case wouldn't linear regression would be bad. A more flexible approach would produce much better predictors. So how could she decide which algo to use? I am having really hard time picturing the scenario.

And what if the variables are correlated. How do someone with no stats account for that?"
"112","Throw XGBoost at it, I imagine."
"113","More or less this, yeah. You can infinitely divide the real number line."
"114","I know this isn't the place to rant but here's something related to what you said. A friend of mine and myself graduated with PhDs in a biology field in 2017. I had already moved into a more computational subfield and had taken graduate statistical analysis courses. By the time I graduated I had about the equivalent of a masters level training in stats based on the projects I'd participated in (based on other statistician friend's evaluation).

Well jump to one year later and my friend is asking for advice about how to learn more stats. I give them some resources and next thing I know see they have finished a data science ""boot camp"" (whatever the fuck that even means) and now their LinkedIn says Firstname Lastname, Data Scientist. Holy shit, they know absolutely nothing about stats and got hired by an insurance company for their data science lead. Meanwhile, I've finished my postdoc and can't find a job in tech for the better part of 15 months. Now, as if to taunt me, I see their LinkedIn posts as they updates their progress on basic level R and Python online courses, ""Yeah! Just finished the ggplot course. Yeah! Just learned how to do linear regression! #DataScientist""

It makes my blood boil.

All these people flooding the industry with no knowledge or experience whatsoever and it's affecting the hiring of people like me who genuinely know what their talking about and are trying to make the transition to industry. I realize not all boot camps are alike and not all students are alike but this has to stop. Most companies are figuring out now that ""data scientist"" is an essentially meaninglessness term that will eventually be broken down into coherent jobs over the next decade. But in the mean time, data science will continue to be an utterly empty term that has become the new buzzword for marketing departments."

"123","DS could actually use a lot more gatekeeping precisely because of what your friend did.

&amp;#x200B;

Far, far too many people entering who never learned proper stats. Maybe I'm bitter because I sat through a bunch of lin. algebra based stats courses in grad school and then did a few years of field work before I started doing anything remotely like 'data science'. I also taught myself the theory behind ML methods rather than just learn how to import a pre-trained model and every time I hear how ""AI"" is magic and we are going to ""get the low hanging fruit with an MVP!"" it honestly makes me want to quit my job and go be a monk somewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I actually am employed with 'data scientist' as my title and I feel I'm fairly compensated but it took a long time. Not a bootcamp + a short internship. And I don't even think I'm really that good! I'm p. jealous of some of my coworker's knowledge. Thankfully the boot camp types tend to bomb out of interviews where I work just given the nature of the questions and who's typically asking them.

&amp;#x200B;

If I had to make an analogy, I feel like ""Data Science"" as a degree and doubly the bootcamps are like putting someone in a wood shop with every tool you can imagine, and teaching them how to use each tool one by one. And at the end, expecting them to be able to build an armoire even though you never taught them how to actually make anything, you just taught them how to use a saw."
"124","&gt;What I realized is that most of this programs do not actually provide  the necessary tools for doing a correct statistical analysis. They focus  on visual presentation of results and some coding (which don't get me  wrong, is quite important), but they do not teach what you actually need  to do a good project: statistical theory ( and maybe some maths to  understand the insides of the processes, but if all they do is of an  applied nature, I think this is more of secondary importance).

&amp;#x200B;

I think some of the reason for that is we have very successful kinds of models with very underdeveloped statistical theory. Successful gradient boosting algorithms are essentially simple algorithms with lots of clever engineering and heuristics. There's not a good theoretical understanding of why neural networks are able to generalize well. At the same time there's a lot of practical stuff to learn before you can use these models successfully. So people naturally focus on getting to the point where they can produce good results, which doesn't require a lot of theory.


&gt;As a result, I have seen projects which , even if they are very pretty  to look at, show a lack of understanding of some basic  ideas of  statistics, such as running an OLS regression with no or few controls in  a non-experimental setting and claiming to have found a causal  relationship between the variables.



This is not new. Before data science there were lots of highly paid professionals making bad inferences from OLS regression. The situation is probably better now that there are easily accessible communities like reddit and stackexchange where people can be told not to do that."

I think this is a critical factor that actually creates a very meaningful differentiation across different ""subareas"" of data science:

If you work for a company whose core offering isn't data science driven (e.g., not tech, not software), then data science is a secondary/auxiliary tool, and the primary philosophical you may have as a data scientist become nonsense to the key decision makers - all that matters to them is outcomes. 

Example: if you work for sales and you come up with a shitty model that is rife with statistical no-nos, but that model increases sales by 10% and is ready right now, there is no amount of statistical naysaying that is going to prevent that model from getting used unless you can come up with a model that increases sales by more.

And the issue is that sales is one of like 4 functions that both exist in virtually every company *and* are frequently the key decision makers in the company (i would argue that marketing, finance and supply chain are the other 3). So the majority of data scientists are going to be working in environments where statistical correctness is like a tertiary conocern at best."

I mean, that's the entire point of this thread. It might not even be true that the model increases sales by 10%how do you know that it does if the modeling procedure and experimental design is rife with statistical errors?"
"127","Because, at this point, it is cheaper to run an A/B test than it is to critically design and review an experiment."
"128","You can't A/B test everything."
"129","Don't get me wrong, I think you're right in that there needs to be *some* statistical backing to making statements such as ""sales increased by 10%"".

I think there are two issues:

**In a lot of cases, the time/effort/cost of setting up an experimental design that would allow you to conclusively make that statement is prohibitive.**

Example: I worked on a project where we were testing the impact that a pricing initiative would have. We were asked to look at both the impact on margins and the impact on volume. Simple enough.

The problem is that there were so many moving variables that it was virtually impossible to control for the right variables and maintain a meaningful sample given that we were restricted to a specific geographic region for testing. If we wanted to get a clean read on the impact of the project, we would have needed to control for salesperson, customer type, purchase type, purchase frequency, assortment, specific item, channel - just to name a few. More importantly, we only had like 200 customers to work with. 

This is all on top of the fact that we worked in an industry that relied on about 15-20 other commodity markets, all of which were liable to fluctuate and impact both sales - and definitely margins. 

When you really got down to it, there were more moving parts to this project than we could reasonably control for. Which meant that no matter what type of experimental design we came up with, odds were that we were going to get an inconclusive answer.

So that's half of the equation: you literally may not be able to get a clean answer without spending a ton of time  testing - and because of the speed at which business and business innovation happens, if someone thinks the idea is good in principle and seems promising at a high level, no one is going to stand in the way of it. And that is because...

**The risk associated with rolling something out which has already been developed is normally low**

Let's say you ran some high level numbers and you find that you grew sales by 10%. You know in your statistical heart that it is really 10% +- 15%, and there are about 10 factors that could caveat that growth. But all in all, you tested the model in reality, you saw 10% growth based on some sort of simple test/control design, and the results look more positive than negative. Not good enough to bet your life that they are sustainable, but good enough to bet someone lunch that they are.

You roll out the program and it turns out that when you expand it to the full set of customers, that +10% you saw before become -1%. You find out in rolling it out that there were issues that didn't impact the initial set of customers that are a problem now. Or maybe some of the efforts required of your workforce don't scale as well. Or maybe you just got lucky during testing.

Whatever the case may be, *the cost to pivot away from this project and/or improve it to address issues is much lower than the opportunity cost of not going after 10% growth.*

To divide that into two parts:

1. When something doesn't work because of a design flaw, there are almost always process + execution considerations that can be taken in order to address that. It's rare that a concept that held water from a conceptual and testing standpoint cannot be fixed/addressed when it runs into issues.
2. Worst case scenario, you jump ship. You ax the project, take the loss, and move on. And in expectation, you're better off if 50% of the time you hit on a +10% growth project, and 50% of the time you cut your losses and move on to the next project than if you wait to have extensive enough testing to convince yourself that you are 100% going to see growth.

Again, this is not true in every industry - there are industries where, because of the speed and magnitude at which business happens (i.e., high frequency, low magnitude), you are 100% better off setting up a good testing protocol to make sure that whatever you are seeing can be as close to certainty as possible. Example: if you're Amazon and you want to roll out an improvement to your pricing engine, you 100% want to test it to the point where you are 99.99% sure that you will see positive returns, because you have the platform, business model, transaction frequency, low testing risk, high production risk combination that makes it all work out in the favor of good, fundamentally sound statistical testing.

But when you're talking about industries like B2B, with huge transaction values, low transaction frequency, largely offline sales platforms, opaque market conditions, dependencies on maybe multiple commodity markets, loooooong sales cycles, etc., then you're not going to get a nice, clean environment on which you can run such testing.

Having said all of that: I agree with you that even in those cases, it's better for someone to choose the best possible experimental design out of the options available. I have seen, even in those circumstances where there are a lot of ""as right as it's going to be"" options, people who choose the categorically wrong way to evaluate a program."
"130","You raise a lot of good points. It's true that there's many moving parts to an analysis or data science solution and that you might be unable to control for everything. But your statistical knowledge is still useful since you were able to identify these problems and eventual weaknesses of the proposed solution(s). 

Someone who just knows how to maximize AUC by any means necessary won't be able to identify these problems and their solution might look good on paper, but could be useless in reality. 

However, I'll concede that the skill set we are talking about isn't purely statistical, it's closer to general data science knowledge/experiencebut sound statistical reasoning is an important part of that skill set."
"131","&gt; Someone who just knows how to maximize AUC by any means necessary won't be able to identify these problems and their solution might look good on paper, but could be useless in reality.

Completely fair. And I have ran into people in my lifetime who presented results to leadership that were so fundamentally flawed that I had to underhandedly shoot down their whole project by escalating up my chain of command."
"132","Almost halfway through a master's degree in Data Science. Can confirm. Also, you should do a video series on how to do data science properly."

"134","My experience is that nowadays there are many people looking for becoming a ""data scientist"" (sounds catchy, right?) without wanting to learn the basics as math and stats. We all how businesses work: people want to  have some sort or tittle? Let's sale it. They take some coursera courses, some datacamp workshop and now they feel they have became a data scientist. 
Now, have you count how many online courses/YouTube videos / blogs are about data science? How they all promise to teach you? Funny is that many of them copy from each other, reproducing mistakes and of course, omitting all the proper statistical basics, all the theory. It's all really applied, no deep theory, no sustain.
It's becoming really hard to take serious the label of data scientist. I don't really know what to expect from them."
"135","Companies : ""Maybe if we get PHDs theyll be better?!?!"" How about you understand what the fuck the thing is that youre employing people for. Do most data scientists even understand what the generalization of a standard linear regression is?"
"136","Can confirm. From a consulting and data provider firm. 

I am astonished at the clear lack of understanding of basic foundations of creating quality datasets with sound methodologies and then presenting said data to an audience. 

They feel because they know the subject matter of which the data represents, that they know the data. I find this laughable because to me it's not really about what you're trying to analyse (like footballs), but how you do it and the underpinning ""science"" behind the data.

I raised this point in objection to the placing of a particular person on a data platform creation project only to be shot down because ""they know the subject matter and you don't.""

There are a lot of ways to fail and the most dangerous ones are these logic/statistical errors as they dont throw an error at you when you do them."
"139","I think it just depends on job scope, if your goal is to build software that makes predictions, little to no stats is required but visualization, programming are critical. If your designing experiments, then coding isnt necessarily as critical. Ultimately if the math someone is using isnt sound, the results will speak for themselves, event to nontechnical people"
"140","In my experience, when people learn to use basics in a few Python libraries (ex. pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn,...) they start to call themselves data scientist. And this is because of all DS courses online (there are some really good ones, but most of them is there just to be sold), which is growing industry. Now, 90% of people think that DS is Python or R and some visualizatons. The other problem is that the companies don't know much more about DS too, and we have a perfect environment for those who can sell sh** and get away with it."
"141","Machine learning is basically p-hacking to imply causality which does not really have to exist (not literally, but this is the result). 

The word ""scientist"" is used very loosely in the field because the majority of data scientists are not scientists at all. 

I have a PhD in Neuroscience and when I tell fellow Scientists that I am a data scientist now, they know what I mean and that it is not real science. 

The fact that the techniques someone uses are complex, does not make it scientific. 

But hey! Hush hush as we are making good money with our fake science :)."
"142","I remember the time when people said computer science wasn't a science. Data science appears to be going through the same birth pains.

Of course, it's a science. You mean, presumably, some practitioners aren't very scientific in their methods, which is true. But that doesn't make the discipline unscientific. Data science is multi-disciplinary, combining a number of scientific methods found in computer science and mathematics."
"143","&gt;I remember the time when people said computer science wasn't a science.

I remembered this as well! 

To this day I'd meed people who think CD is nothing more than doing HTMLs!"
"144","Machine learning can be applied to a Bayesian model, eliminating the flawed concept of p-values altogether."
"145","You see, it's these kind of data wizards that believe now suddenly it is scientific. 

It's not. 

Usually your data is not retrieved in a controlled clean manner. On top of that, many data scientist ""clean"" their data sets to facilitate machine learning, which by itself is not scientific. You must have a very valid reason to remove even outliers. Removing data is highly frowned upon when doing data analysis. There is a word for it: fishing. 

You will get ""real world"" data without having had any control on any potential influences. 

When you find any sort of statistical connection between one variable and the other and it is actually causal, you were just lucky. Sure, the math shows it is ""causal"" in your data but that does not mean it is in the real world. 

It is not a mathematical problem, I am sure you know your maths/data wrangling, it is a methodological problem with the majority of data ""science""."
"146","&gt; You will get ""real world"" data without having had any control on any potential influences.

Im not a seasoned practitioner, but I feel like most data sets of interest dont give you any control. Most phenomena dont occur in an experimental setting or with any ability to control for things explicitly. I work in auto insurance. Its pretty hard to experiment with accident claims or fraud detection. To me thats kind of the fun of it. It doesnt mean I cant use statistics to better understand whats going on.

More generally, I feel like people have these stories they use to explain phenomena that the data is derived from. These stories are pretty simple and sometimes theres data that contradict them. The science part is seeing how the data matches with peoples informal stories and hypotheses. But theres a domain-specific art to creating new hypothesesnew storiesabout how the world works that better explain the data and what we see."
"147","I guess my point is that machine learning doesn't have to be p-hacking if it's applied to a Bayesian model. Also, the fact that medical fields still use p-values shows an atrocious lack of statistical understanding."
"148","This, I agree with."
"149","Well, you also don't call Programmers Computer Scientists. Maybe we need a new name?"
"150","So what's your opinion on frequentist vs Bayesian statistics?"
"151","With this in mind then, what is best route into data science? Is it to do maths and statistics for a bachelors and follow with a data science masters?"
"152","meanwhile I'm wasting my time in undergrad learning about L\^p spaces and how they are relevant in studying random variables. completely useless for data science it seems! =C=C=C=C=C=C"
"153","I guess Im best described as a Data Janitor"
"154","No.

What's worst is a statistician who can only use SAS. Doesn't know command line, how create readable and reproducible code, doesn't know about Git/parallel computing/etc.

I would take a competent programmer any day of the week over a statistician who can't solve a fizz buzz problem"
"155","Assuming the competent programmer is incompetent in stats, the fact that you think one is significantly better than the other is exactly the problem OP is trying to point out."
"156","Lol because they are significantly better than the other.

If you ask me who I would rather hire on my team, its going to be the competent programmer with weak stats skills 10 times out of 10.

I've had to work with PhD's in stats who create spaghetti code and ask the most asinine questions that should've been answered in a first year programming course."
"157","Code Monkey &gt; Statistical Background?

Code can be taught. Give me someone with a stats background and a humble approach."
"158","Not even close.

Having a working knowledge of distributed systems, writing efficient/clean code and building production systems will trump any nerd with a stats background. Most stats knowledge is abstracted anyways, read a stats 101 intro book and you're good."
"159","So is there a basic agreed upon list of what someone should know before they can call themselves a data scientist? If not can we crowdsource one here?"
"160","So is ""data science"" just ""statistics lite"""
"161","Not really fam"
"162","you're joking right?  of course. completely, each and every day.

"163","Two things in this post: First, data vis of Star Wars' performance on Facebook and Twitter. We got the data from the APIs and visualized it using Crowdbabble (you could also use D3 for free, if you don't mind some JavaScript coding). Second, embedding those visualizations within Sway, Microsoft's new presentation tool.

Having tried it out, I think Sway could be useful to the data scientists + visualizers here, because it's fully responsive. Rather than trapping your work in PowerPoint, and making it pretty impossible to see on mobile without a lot of zooming and pinching, you might consider Sway. They're both made by Microsoft, but Sway seems to be a lot better suited to mobile and other screen sizes. "
"164","I wanted to maintain a bus commute as both stops are closer to my work/home. Three times this week, I've taken the metro or an uber instead because the next bus was listed as ""schedule data"" -- which means it might come late or not at all -- or it wasn't coming for FORTY MINUTES.  On a main route.  I'm not standing in 27 degree temperature for 40 minutes to help beta-test Metro's tracker system."
"165","Yeah, bus operations/data quality definitely needs work. It's not uncommon for [\~15% of scheduled bus trips to be missing from WMATA's real-time data during weekday morning rush](https://twitter.com/dcmetrohero/status/1214584753355141120), for example. Hopefully this is something Metro and the region takes more seriously soon given [this subject is touched upon in the actions plans of the Bus Transformation Project](https://twitter.com/jamespizzurro/status/1215339818143617024), but we'll see."
"166","Who are you who are so wise in the way of science?

Seriously though, do you work in transportation, or is this just a hobby?"
"167","Lead Developer of [MetroHero](https://dcmetrohero.com) here. It's just a hobby. A really, uh, annoying hobby where you get to learn all the things wrong with transit data and operational challenges at agencies like WMATA, but can't do a whole lot about it. ="
"168","[Here is another example](https://ibb.co/1zn0G3B). Its 7 pm in Chinatown and there isnt a bus for 45 minutes. I often walk 2 miles home from work because it's faster than the bus."
"169","Buses get stuck in traffic and seem to attract more crazies than the metro. Have had numerous buses not show up at all or pass the stop completely. The drivers often are unprofessional. And a metro plus walking or uber can get you almost anywhere here without the previous mentioned annoyances."
"170","The Metro doesn't have to deal with traffic *shrug*"
"171","And the stations are warm!"
"172","I may be in the minority here, but I actually enjoy the Metrobus system. It's useful and fills in a lot of gaps that the rail system doesn't cover, and as long as BusETA is accurate (and not using ""schedule data"", which I hate because that's always bad news), it's pretty much accurate."
"173","I enjoy it when there is a bus running relatively close to my departure time. I just hate opening my bus app to see no scheduled buses or a bus in 30+ minutes."
"174","I only use the schedule if I'm leaving a station. If I'm headed to a station then use a tracking app like DC Metro Transit. Once in a blue moon there's a ghost bus but it's pretty spot on."
"175","[removed]"
"176","I mean, why pay $10 for an Uber when you can just hire a private driver to drive you everywhere. The car would be nicer and the driving would be better.

For real though, your scenario costs $16/day more. That's nearly $4,000 more per year on your commute. Most people don't have $4,000 to blow just on getting to/from work a little faster."
"177","Wow can't wait for r/washingtonDC to tell me why everything is bad and wrong about public transportation! Surely they won't whine about poor people and talk about how great Uber is!"
"178","What are you talking about? Anytime someone comes here to say something to the effect that cars are better than transit they get downvoted."
"179","Spark would be at the top of my list: you can install and run for free on your laptop right now. It supports mainly scala, java and python. Although scala is the native interface for spark, I would actually recommend python (pyspark). There are a bunch of books and courses on the topic.

Now, for all the others you mention: hadoop is only worth learning for historical purposes. Even Cloudera, the last Hadoop distributor, stopped mentioning it. Its still an impressive technology, but largely overshadowed by cloud solutions.

I think its better to learn architectures rather than specific technologies: data warehousing (kimball, inmon, data vault...), streaming (lambda vs kappa), types of DB (SMP/MPP, doc oriented, graph, wide column store...)...
Data engineering is more about solving data challenges than just « big » data.

I would also recommend adding Kafka and elasticsearch to your list.
Using a combo of Spark + Kafka (confluent) + elasticsearch + MPP of your choice (clickhouse, delta...) allows you to understand and prototype incredibly sophisticated solutions."
"180","The answers to both those questions could be determined using statistics, I'd recommend brushing up on it. For both questions, using sampling methods, you could get a better idea about true population size. You could run some experiments, gather data, make a few assumptions, and get an estimate with a 95% confidence interval, for example."
"181","As a data analyst interested in data science, my research has led me to believe that statistics is the number one skill a data scientist can posses. How accurate is that and if it's indeed accurate, aren't people looking to break into data science probably best served by taking an advanced degree (masters or phd, assuming they interested in forking out the cash for an advanced degree) in statistics vs an equivalent degree in data science or some similar tract?"
"182","It depends. The contents of traditional stats program vary; adding the even wider variation of ""data science"", it's hard to say if a stats program prepares one better.

Traditional stats program spends enormous amount of time on things that are...not useful. It tends to lack reliable sources to learning programming best practices (how many people writes functions in R?). Most projects are done using toy datasets that work out too nicely for their intended purposes.

I would argue that it's unlikely that either program prepares one to be a data scientist. I'm pretty sure everyone ends up spending tons of time learning and doing side projects on their own.

If anything, a traditional stats program let you do something like when marketing guy says his regression model has R\^2 of .95 therefore the marking effort was incredible, you frown because he didn't check residuals (but of course you don't say anything and just let meeting continues).

It takes time to learn how to do things. Your attention and perseverance is what it takes, and you'll for sure learn eventually if you have those things."

"191","Here's some of the best advice I know about how to prepare for interviews:

https://80000hours.org/career-guide/how-to-get-a-job/#how-to-prepare-for-interviews

1. ""When you meet an employer, ask lots of questions to understand their challenges.""
2. ""Prepare your three key selling points ahead of meetings.""
3. ""Focus on whats most impressive.""
4. ""Prepare concrete facts and stories to back up your three key messages.""
5. ""Work out how to sum up what you have to offer in a sentence.""
6. ""Prepare answers to the most likely questions.""
7. ""Practice the meeting, from start to finish.""
8. ""Learn. After each interview, jot down what went well, what could have gone better, and what youll do differently next time."""
"192","[deleted]"
"193","&gt;Im always the guy that says, what do you mean by significant/outlier/etc.

Usually, that's a good thing! I'm surprised."
"194","can relate. I'm not one to quickly regurgitate some stock answer in an interview.

I don't feel I interview well but maybe that is my perception as I've certainly worked at some major companies.

Thankfully my references explain how I am and I haven't had to interview in years."
"195","This is one of those cases where the username doesn't check out."
"196","[deleted]"
"197","If you have a master's degree in data science, or Kaggle projects, or if you've worked through a reading list, or taken online courses in data science -- those things are good! But seek out real experience as early and extensively as possible."
"198","Yeah I have a masters in stats, havent done any MANOVAs or the like at all. Kinda want to go do refresher projects on those now lol"
"199","Im currently applying to internships that I can work at while Im doing my masters which starts this fall. Would you count that as real world experience or do you strictly mean professional full-time work?"
"200","Internships count as ""real-world"" experience."
"201","Just to be a bit snarky, Entry level position, need at least 3 years of experience."
"202","I think you should apply your statistical reasoning to this issue rather than this emotional response."
"203","Ok :)"
"204","It's easy to say work at a company with data before, or get a research assistant under a professor., But the ground reality is different.
Most of times, without experience it is difficult to be able to get to work at a company, it's a never ending of loop of companies wanting experience vs us not having one and looking for the same. 
And professors don't respond, I have sent out countless mails to professors, asking to volunteer, but none replied. At this stage even if I genuinely want to get real world experience, I can't do anything. 
As I said it feels like a   never ending loop, with nobody ready to offer you the chance."
"205","I'm in the same boat, but I think that's where the ""collected and analysed data for fun"" bit comes in. You can count it as real experience."
"206","Can you post an example of the kind of email you sent to professors? If you like, I can give some feedback."
"207","I will dm you, if that's fine"
"208","Ok feel free to dm me."
"209","The more you are familar with real life experience, the better you are.

Real life problems are not perfectly cleaned data from university/Kaggle. It requires hard work, policies, privacy concerns... to get to the desire ouput before actual DS work. Therefore unless you are in a really professional team, you would end up involved in data collection part anyway.

Also proper domain knowledge are better than Machine Learning most of the time, which is hard to swallow for fresh out of college new comers."
"210","Another thing to consider is that knowing the ""messiness"" of the data can really help in modelling it with correct assumptions."
"211","Certainly real experience is important and I understand prospective data scientists often overemphasize textbook type knowledge. However, the two categories you laid out seem arbitrary. I don't know how you can say working with data as part of a research project is good experience and a masters degree isn't."
"212","&gt;I don't know how you can say working with data as part of a research project is good experience and a masters degree isn't.

Regrettably, the experience that students get as part of a master's degree is quite different from the experience that people get working as a research assistant, or at a company, or even on their own personal projects. That doesn't mean the experience people gain in a master's degree is useless, but it's different from work experience."
"213","Yeah the knowledge in a masters degree is more theoretical. But aren't the people in your first category better suited for an entry level job? While the other group, depending on the experience, would get a regular job. Because it sounds you would dismiss the first category completely as potential candidates.
It all depends on the company and the job offering, I know."
"214","We definitely wouldn't dismiss the master's degree students as potential candidates. But the best potential candidates have worked on data projects for fun and they've usually tried to seek out real-world data projects."
"215","Kaggle projects ARE for fun though. And its real world data. Your points are in conflict with one another...."
"216","It's not what I would call ""real world data"" because the data they use never has the TRULY BIZARRE crap that we run across all the time in industry. An awful lot of data science is basically janitorial work - hooking up the pipes, making sure everything is clean, and checking it out if something smells weird. It's gotten to the point where ""data custodian"" or ""data janitor"" roles sometimes exist in teams just to make sure that the data getting to the analysts, data scientists, and machine learning engineers is even a tenth as clean as Kaggle data."
"217","Thats still an entirely separate problem than the statistical learning of data, which means Kaggle is STILL experience. This tells me you dont write off the data from Kaggle, rather you need more experience in the ETL pipeline of how to get data and transform it into a usable form. Then you already have the experience in taking usable data and gaining insights from it."
"218","Sure. Can you agree that this still doesn't make it ""experience with real-world data"" though? The points OP is making aren't in conflict.   


Also, I think it's important to understand that there's a lot more that happens in cleaning data than ETL and transformation in industry. It's certainly important, but I come across data sources regularly that don't have a data dictionary, haven't ever had any profiling done on them, represent data from three different phases of business logic with no rhyme or reason explaining the differences, etc. It's a lot of slow, careful, detailed analysis, combined with straight-up detective work, and fixing other peoples' well-intentioned mistakes."
"219","Totally agree with you on that point. Best way to learn is to get your hands dirty. Most data you'll get in a masters or by kaggle etc. will be pre cleaned to fit the lesson."
"220","Disagree with the assumption that ""most data you'll get in a master's course will be pre cleaned to fit the lesson"".  I pulled data from 12 different real-world sources for my MS Econ masters project (and I know that others in my cohort pulled real-world data too, as our projects were econometric by nature).  I'd be surprised to learn my school was the exception to masters projects/theses (correct me if I should be, though)."
"221","Probably because you were studying economics. I'd bet that on pure math or CS focused courses you wouldn't have that experience."
"222","I agree. I have an econ background and have interviewed tons of people, and it seems like it's common for econ students to get a lot of hands-on experience with data through RA jobs, replication exercises, or writing papers for classes, while CS students typically don't. 

Meanwhile, the DS/ML Master's students I've talked to seem to have taken a zillion classes and covered a huge amount of ground within a year and a half, but their understanding is shallow and they forget most of what they've learned by the time they show up to the interview."
"223","That's really good. Maybe there's a switch currently, cause I had some experiences as described above. But if there's more practical work with real world data in masters you'll be better prepared for industry work.
But it all depends on the masters curriculum and the university as a whole."
"224","Question: What if you worked with data in a company but it doesnt align with the work that you are interested in? Im currently developing ETL processes and cleaning data and although I understand how critical this is in the data science workflow, I want to better utilize my quantitative skills to help build models and interpret results.

Im currently writing towards a masters degree on a part time basis to update my mathematical skills and recently started freelancing where I can utilize my research, math and coding skills to produce a deliverable for my client. Is this the right direction?

Thanks!"
"225","How large (approximately) is the company you currently work at?

Often you can move into a more ""data science""-y role by working at a smaller company (e.g. 10-50 employees) where the needs for a ""data person"" are more diverse and less specialised into particular roles. If you have experience working with real data and you can show some modelling skills, that could be a promising direction -- you could *potentially* move directly into a ""Data Scientist"" role."
"226","Can I ask you a question about how to ""sell"" myself? I'm preparing to leave academia after a PhD in experimental psychology + 3 years postdoc research. My problem is that people hear ""psychology"" and don't necessarily think ""data"".  

My job involves quite a lot of experimental design, big datasets, all kinds of scripting (python, mostly), coding of experimental programs using C# and taking care of our AWS environment that hosts everything. And of course lots of reports and presentations, which might be useful as well.  
My side projects mostly deal with web scraping and social listening to gather and analyse some massive datasets using NLP (definitely some messy data in there).  
So I think I'd have some experience but I might not get to the point to explain it if I'm labeled ""psychologist"".

Any tips you can give or insight into how someone with my background would be perceived?"
"227","It sounds like you have a strong background, and it's interesting - it would provide a lot of experience for you to talk about in interviews.

As you realise, how you brand yourself does matter. While I don't really like Ramit Sethi's tone, his ""How to Write a Winning Resume"" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0fjkKCsM1w] is very helpful for thinking about this.

The key thing is to work out your own narrative to explain: ""I studied xyz, I found it fascinating, I decided to do a PhD in AbC. I found working with data was really interesting but I wanted to pursue this in industry rather than academia because it had more hands-on immediate results"" or whatever is true in your case. Also check out https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/data-science/ which might be helpful, and https://mode.com/blog/data-scientists-making-the-leap-academia-to-industry."
"228","That's some really helpful stuff - thank you! And good point on the narrative, definitely some good advice for me to work on."
"229","You're welcome! Let us know how you go. :)"
"230","I can't tell you anything on the hard skills but I can give you a general industry perspective. You've got an outside view - which /can/ be a good thing. I'd shift the focus more onto the skills and work experience and less onto your field of study, though.

Highlight your projects, your work processes and your collaborations.
Fundamentally, companies need to make money, so you have to show that you can work productively in their environment and help them reach their goals. Try to show the interviewers how the skills - which you have - can address the company's problems - which you need to find out.

Depending on how the interview process works ask them questions about typical problems that you'd encounter in the job and draw paralleles to how you solved similar problems in the past. 
This will give them an idea on how you approach new situations.

By the by, a PhD is not only quasi work experience but also your first major project management experience. 3+ years with setbacks, problems, adapting your methods, reevaluating your goals, showing perseverance and a willingness for hard work. How you deal with all these setbacks is equally important to the results.
Bonus points if you did grant proposals, worked with large budgets, taught students etc. etc... :)

Also, make sure your cover letter and CV reflect that (dpends a bit in your country, too). Scientific and industrials CVs are very different  and this might make the difference of being invited to the interview."
"231","You may want to consider HR analytics (people analytics).  There is a huge behavioral/psychology component to this field, and finding people in industry  with that expertise who can also wrangle data and code is difficult. Its maybe not as sexy as other DS fields but its pretty interesting."
"232","I was just about to post this. I work in people analytics and I really enjoy it. More and more HR departments are starting to see the value of having a data scientist in the department, especially if said scientist comes from a background in psychology or economics (with a heavy statistical focus of course). Also, soft skills matter quite a bit, and I agree, it's tricky to find data scientists who have some combination of all of these factors. I expect the demand for these roles to increase quite a bit over the next few years."
"233","This is a great suggestion!"
"234","I have kind of a similar background and have established myself in a career focused on a/b testing / experimentation at scale. Id suggest reframing your background from psychology to experimental psychology since people in other fields dont necessarily know how quantitative psychology can be. You might also consider looking into data science roles that focus more on inference and less on ML. Theres a real need for people who can advise on experimental methods and unlike ML its not necessarily an area where software engineers can fill the gap"
"235","Have an acquaintance that was accepted to Hulu with your kind of background. Might want to try companies like that."
"236","Ngl y'all have a doe background that would get you into engineering.

So frustrating to see employment numbers for experimentals"
"237","I have a similar issue. Background in nursing and Masters in Public Health, 3-5 years ""working with data"", but I never really feel qualified for postings."
"238","I work in a startup, and your post makes a whole lot of sense to me just from what I've seen.

Almost none of the work I do is clean cut implementation of cutting edge ML models. The vast majority is solving problems related to data storage, collection, manipulation and enrichment. Our deep learning networks are pretty basic in the grand scheme of things and I'd expect anyone with even a basic understanding of ML to be able to understand and replicate them. 

Instead, what I find most useful is working very closely with my other founders, and leveraging their domain expertise to understand what exactly the features and structure of our models should be, and working to design our data collection applications accordingly.

Admittedly, this is a small company with very different challenges to major organisation, but unquestionably I'd agree that the skills I need at this stage are less on the theoretical and more on the practical 'hands dirty' kind of experience you mentioned."
"239","Thanks for your perspective. :)"
"240","Ive had interviewers want the opposite from me. I have experience at my Uni in two different fields as a data scientist: pharmaceuticals, retail. 

I didnt have enough real world experience because it was still attached through the university. 

Youre right to seek real projects, but university and research positions didnt help me with a job in industry. 

What did help me: my personal website with a portfolio and rundown of: tutorials, personal projects, tools Ive developed. This shows I love what I do, and can take the time communicate it."
"241","&gt; my personal website with a portfolio and rundown of
&gt; This shows I love what I do, and can take the time communicate it.

This is really valuable if you clearly do data science projects for fun!"
"242","I actually am finishing up soon both a BME AND Biostats MS and I still dont feel qualified enough.

My statistical analysis skills are strong but my programming/CS skills are pretty week despite having been in engineering too (BE undergrad didnt teach us that well and neither did grad in both fields)I am able to do classical and semi classical statistics like GLMs/Mixed models (probably what I am best at), ridge/lasso, PCA, discriminant analysis. I am most comfortable with R and only know very little Python. I have no experience with genomics and high dim data analysis. 

Also know absolute 0 about know classes/structs, databases, APIs, RShiny, or production. No knowledge about making code faster or algorithms. 

But I sure as hell can come up with p values (that rhe data sci real world doesnt care about). My next assignment is using 300+ variables as predictors to try to predict Alzheimers diagnoses on around 700 patients. Still p&lt;n. Probably will be making use of glmnet() or PCA. 

My program also doesnt teach modern things like NNs/deep learning etc. Its a heavily classical oriented thing. How can a classically trained biostatistician get into data sci if CS skills are weak?"
"243","Hmm. What kind of data science roles are you interested in?"
"244","Stuff like Biomedical Data Scientist.

I dont mind statistician jobs too but I am trying to broaden my search"
"245","My guess is that you have a lot of valuable skills.

If you're interested in becoming a Biomedical Data Scientist, the key thing I'd suggest is getting experience working on a project with a researcher in biomedicine -- have you considered that?"
"246","Yes I have done research in BME. Even recently published a paper. However, it has been entirely classical statistics with some semi classical stuff here and there. 

I help labmates analyze their wet lab datasets, which are generally small datasets. That is where I got experience with the typical classical models like GLMs, GLMMs as well as tools such as Bootstrap. Some ggplot2 plotting as well and Monte Carlo simulations. 

Then in Biostats I am working with someone on looking at MRI data *however* all the preprocessing and so on is done and I dont even see the image. We dont deal with the actual image and we just deal with measures derived from it. Its entirely mostly classical longitudinal analysis. 

That stuff isnt exactly sexy in todays data science climate. Many data scientists dont even know this stuff at all but it doesnt matter. 

My next part though I requested that PI to give me something more modern, but it is essentially going to still be semi-classical prediction using basic ML with a large number of predictors (already derived from the image) to predict AD risk. 

For data science I often see things like web scraping, knowing APIs, cloud computing, interfacing models with medical devices (production), big data, databases and so on. I know none of that, only the statistical aspects and in R. 

Its unfortunate but I dont think recruiters appreciate classically trained statisticians. We arent exactly known for being good programmers. 

I still struggle a lot with basic Python. It doesnt make sense to me as I am not good with OOP but R I am fine"
"247","In data science no-one is going to know everything, so I wouldn't worry about not knowing about web scraping, APIs, etc. too much. Data science roles are diverse, and in any role you'll need to learn new skills, and many of your existing skills will be very useful for you.

There's a difference as well between more ""science""-oriented roles vs. more ""engineering""-oriented roles in data science. Your skills are more aligned towards the first category than the second, but you could invest some time into learning software engineering practices.

If you want to go into biomedical data science, the key thing will be finding positions -- e.g. in biomedical companies or (possibly) academic contexts. The earlier you can seek out those positions and speak to people at those companies / institutions to get their advice, and to get a sense of what positions are available, the better."
"248","Yea its funny, I actuallt have the BME engineering degree but I was always better at the science (as in chem/physics etc) and data analysis stats type things. I was never good with building things or in this case production level code stuff.

I think I really need industry experience. Never had an internship unfortunately and first job is notoriously difficult to get. I have had phone interviews but nothing more yet. Some positions also seem like phantom positions and dont actuallt exist but the recruiters are seeing what is out there...The job world equivalent of Tinder girls seeking validation etc"
"249","I feel like 1 and 2 aren't mutually exclusive. I am currently a masters in business analytics student and landed a full time data science type role. My background when I interviewed and accepted the offer was 1 year of experience in my masters, and some simple excel stuff in my previous role. What I did during my studies helped prepare me for the job though. For example, one of the projects I worked on for a machine learning course happened to use a very messy dataset from kaggle, involving something I was interested in from a personal perspective. Judging by your segmentation, I would fall into the ill-prepared category, however every performance review I've had since starting at my new role has been stellar. I also have not had an internship and have not worked as a research assistant during my degree.

So, my advice to you would be to loosen the reigns a bit and don't enter into interviews with these candidates with such a shrewd eye. You may be surprised."
"250","Interesting. Can you talk more about the dataset you were interested in from a personal perspective? (No need to go into details if you are not comfortable doing that here)

Also -- did you have previous work experience?"
"251","Sure, np. The dataset is from open powerlifting. It contains meet results for various powerlifting competitions dating back to 1970. Some of the competitions were for bench, squat and deadlift, while others were only bench, or squat and deadlift.  There was data for men and women, and age groups for kids through seniors. Country, lifting federation, drug testing results. Essentially all of the stats you would expect for a powerlifting competition. There is significant missing data, and in general it's what would be considered a narrow dataset and required a lot of feature engineering before any kind of analysis could be performed. There was ample opportunity to flex my skills in EDA and build some visualizations, looking at some of the time series elements as well how the data is clustered and distributed. Overall, it was really fun and my main takeaway was that the one thing I enjoy more than anything in the world of data is building compelling visualizations.

I had about 10 years of work experience prior to starting the program, but ina field completely unrelated to data and analytics."
"252","Fascinating. Glad it's going well!"
"253","Id also add any engineering background is a massive tick. If you know how to do something useful with data and can sensibly engineer something so it is actually usable, Id hire you in a heart beat.

Typically these people have experience using a language on the JVM (or a lower level language)"
"254","Software engineering skills are definitely valuable, if combined with experience working with data."
"255","A little off-topic here, but having hired for DS roles, and considering  your points above, I'm curious to know what you'd make of my situation.  I've been applying for (non-senior) DS jobs for 3-4 months now.  I have have detailed on my resume experience with both of your points (the things that I think make me good, and the things that actually do make me good), and yet, after 140+ applications, I've only had one interview (no other contact from potential employers).  I have an MS in econometrics and worked quite a bit with real-world data.  Additionally, I completed a highly competitive and intense post-graduate data science fellowship (top 5% of applicants accepted, required 65 hr. work weeks for the 3 months of the fellowship).  Any advice on better marketing myself (given the limited information you have, of course)?"
"256","It's tricky to give advice without knowing, e.g., where you live; where you are applying for roles; whether you are applying for advertised roles or not; what your cover letters / emails are like; and what your CV is like (in presentation as well as content).

It sounds like you have a strong background. Marketing yourself does matter. While I don't really like Ramit Sethi's tone, his ""How to Write a Winning Resume"" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0fjkKCsM1w] is very helpful for thinking about this.

The key thing is to work out your own narrative to explain: ""I studied xyz, I found it fascinating, I decided to do a PhD in AbC. I found working with data was really interesting but I wanted to pursue this in industry rather than academia because it had more hands-on immediate results"" or whatever is true in your case. Also check out https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/data-science/ which might be helpful, and https://mode.com/blog/data-scientists-making-the-leap-academia-to-industry.

Also, if you have submitted 140+ applications, and only had one interview, you need to re-assess how you are approaching the application process. It sounds like you have a strong skillset. Finding data science roles calls for a combination of (1) time invested, (2) the right technique/approach, and (3) showing you have the necessary experience and skills.

I was able to get a lot of meetings with people from different data companies by sending emails like this:

----
Hi &lt;First name&gt;,

My name is ... 
I'm ... (a sentence about my experience).

Are you looking to hire a data scientist in the next couple of months?
If so, can we meet up and talk about it?

Thanks,

...

My background:

* point 1 ...

* point 2 ... 

* point 3...

----

I didn't attach my CV unless I was asked for it. I emailed dozens of companies and got many interviews."
"257","Are these emails sent to people in DS roles at the company or HR people? And, how would one go about finding emails of specific people? Ive tried using LinkedIn InMail to recruiters at companies of interest, but not much luck. Email is definitely more direct but Im not sure how one would get that info."
"258","Id like to hear /u/tl_throws view on this question too. Im guessing we may have more luck going to hiring managers rather than HR people."
"259","It depends on the size of the company.

My approach here is likely to work better for smaller companies (&lt; 150 employees).

I'd suggest directly emailing the lead data scientist / head of the data team / head of the product team, or even the CTO / CEO of smaller tech companies -- usually you can find emails for these people on the company websites."
"260","If you are not getting interviews after that many applications and you're applying to posted jobs, you are probably getting frequently screened by HR automated systems. DS is very trendy and gets lots of people will apply for every opening, so places are either using automated screening, or their manual screening is so fast as to be as dumb as an automated system.

You need to make sure your resume contains all the keywords someone might screen for, and you need to make sure it's text searchable."
"261","Thats helpful. Been doing my best to match terminology in my resume (so far as to, at times, copy &amp; paste the exact phrases from the job posting). Guess Ill have to become even more particular in how I write my resume?"
"262","Love this post, because I forgot about point 2 as advice for people. Went to an analyst meetup  a couple years ago and announced I was learning python for data science. A retail research company immediately hit me up for a small project.

I got to learn the important things about working on real data projects:

* MESSY survey data from multiple PDFs
* Splotchy responsiveness and communication with stakeholders
* Learning their language, culture, &amp; 'truths' to figure out how to present results
* How to pronounce Paducah, Kentucky

Bottom line is get your hands on some real data if possible. Best case scenario is you can do this within your company and prove out some results. Other cases are that you either have to network locally or reach out to people to get on some projects."
"263","Amazing!"
"264","really well said. as a data scientist who has managed teams of ds's and interviewed/trained new hires, this is 100% what i look for as well"
"265","I briefly studied data science at the graduate level. Most people didn't like coding. Even those who said they liked coding weren't coding. Personally I like coding and that's why I was the first to get poached and got hired in one of the world's largest banks after 3 courses.

I have ***one*** advice: fire up that IDE and code"
"266","Coding is so important!"
"267","Thanks - good to hear an Australian perspective.

Im doing a combo, studying through edX for UCSanDiego and working through accessing and analysing open data available through state government open data portals 

I get little bits and pieces in the BI team at work, but I have to stay on top of my day job in QA."
"268","That's interesting. How do you find the experience of doing both? Do they complement each other well? It sounds like you're doing both at once."
"269","Im using what Im learning in the course to work on the data, jumping around a bit since we havent covered APIs yet. They do complement each other, and the variety means I dont get bored.

Im also doing it to build a portfolio, and hitting datasets for government departments Id like to work for.  The aim is to make up for a lack of workplace experience, with some decent demos of my ability. Plus to demonstrate interest."
"270","That sounds good - although I imagine it can be a bit exhausting!

Many public APIs are quite well-documented so you could probably dive into them right away."
"271","Having just spent the last 3 years transitioning from Session Musician into Data Scientist and taking a decent number of interviews, in the end this advice is close enough to the reality that got me over the line.

The thing that I think may be overlooked is how trivial the real world examples even need to be to do their part, when supported by a couple of more recent achievements (in my case for this I took HDip in Data Science when I decided to make the switch, as well as creating a domain specific open source project:
https://github.com/OscarSouth/theHarmonicAlgorithm).

Real world examples included:

1. Managing a paper database for a hospital as a summer job at 18y. This example also made for some good moments of humour!

2. Querying an Oracle database with ready made SQL queries as part of a temp role as an assistant at a QC lab.

3. Conversations and poking around with toy datasets from friends/family who are professionals in other fields that would like to know what more they can do with their companies data.

Most importantly though (I feel) was how I used these examples in the language of the interviews domain area in response to questions and scenarios thrown at me by the interviewers. Hand in hand with being able to deliver this performance was finding a good fit with people/business  it took a dozen or so interviews to find the right match.

I start on Monday! Im looking forward to it!"
"272","&gt; The thing that I think may be overlooked is how trivial the real world examples even need to be to do their part

Absolutely."
"273","OPs point: what makes you good at a job is real experience at the job.

No shit. This is a terrible take though. If you dont have a job in DS or any actual classroom experience then youre saying all that other shit is irrelevant.

I have a Masters degree, Kaggle work, and taken online courses and I have a Data Engineer job offer on the table right now. You know what makes good experience? Experience."
"274","I broke into data science mostly through hobby projects, and by following this career path:

Chemistry PhD &gt; Bioinformatician &gt; Data Engineer &gt; Data Scientist 

It took 2.5 years after my PhD, but I've finally made it."
"275","Good job! 

It's hard out there, especially for chemists."
"276","So,

to uneducated swines trying to get a job: you have to have this job to get a job!!!

to superior intellectuals who already have a job in the same field in the same exact industry and want to break into industry(??): you're doing fine!

sincerely,

every company and hr in this world

(btw, if you worked with data at your job they'll tell ""but well your data was different type of data, and their data at their specific industry is different so gtfo"").

Thanks for useless advice!"
"277","Has this happened to you?"
"278","yes it did.

I don't understand how this advice makes sense, honestly. I mean yes, it sounds logical, you have more chances to get a job if you have experience. Hiring though isn't even close to anything logical neither it's some kind of exact sceince. All this advice alike ""find problems, then find solutions, then work for free for someone"" just fucks up whole industry and sets further this already absolutely retarded process.

But what does that imply, is that you have to waste more time and energy when you already have qualifications(that's literally what you get diploma for), knowledge and skills, just to get a **chance** at being considered. Then it won't matter 95% of time anyway, because of random BS  most won't even look at your github, will skim through your resume for 3 seconds and throw it in the trash.

Then we get further and further down ""oh no diploma won't cut it, then no, personal projects won't cut it, then no, actually getting paid for work won't cut it'. Fuck this bullshit. You know what ""finding problems and developing solutions"" means? It's called making own business.

Best chance at getting hired is pesonally knowing people in the industry who can get you hired, to skip you through the bullshit of ""you're from wrong industry/have wrong type of diploma/live too far away/don't work with this exact stack we have at company/ don't have experience with real life business problems/ wear wrong pants/ have wrong age"".

If doing all that actually made any difference that would be great, but in actuality it increases your chance by like 1/10 while setting you up for miserable grind and burn out. For every one problem your business is trying to solve there's 100 different businesses who will scoff at your projects because they have different kind of problems, and yours are 'not real world enough' for them. 

Personal projects are cool, trying to sew your whole life around someone's stupid business to maybe get a chance to get hired is stupid, and that's what we're moving too with those posts."
"279","It sounds like you've had a really hard time trying to break in to this industry. If it's any consolation, data science isn't the only industry where this is happening. I have friends who graduated with degrees from BAs to Ph.Ds, in fields from humanities to biochemistry, and they all hit the same ""gotta have experience to get experience"" wall.

Have you thought about being a consultant? A number of consultancies hire based on cultural fit and potential, and provide direct mentoring."
"280","I thankfully didn't get all my energy to get into that field, partly because I noticed that in data science advice like this thread is the norm and competition is insane. I just switched to searching different kind of jobs in IT.

I'm mostly speaking from my experience trying to switch fields before and from all people I know. I don't know a single successful person who went balls deep into some field before actually getting paid for it. And all most successful people I know have general skills and rely on just being liked as a person and can learn stuff quickly when someone's ready to pay for it, and don't sell themselves short.

Last interview I went for I actually didn't apply for myself, I was contacted by their HR and it was business analytics position(my resume just says python programmer). They needed python, finance &amp; statistics knowledge, economic background, UX skills and bunch of other random shit I somehow know. So I, having economics degree and work experience, several UX projects on behance, programing projects on github, some experience with working with data in python on my current job, went there.

And most of the interview guy was rambling about how their sector HoReCa is very different to everything else, and especially having no background in sales company(mine is healthcare) I'm probably not a good fit to work there. They had shitton of very diverse qualification requirements and yet even fitting 90% of them they still thought I'm not good fit because I'm not working in some ultra specialized industry lol. And it's the interview I was invited too by them.

It's just waste of energy and time, shotgun approach and networking all yield much better results in finding any kind of job."

&gt; when you already have qualifications(that's literally what you get diploma for)

""Real-world"" experience is easier and less expensive and more likely to help someone get a role in data science compared to a qualification e.g. an online course or master's degree in data science."
"282","Whiny post is whiny...

&gt;  when you already have qualifications(that's literally what you get diploma for)

A diploma doesn't mean you 'have the qualifications' its simply a certificate that you have a base level of technical competency in the field. As someone who has a Masters in DS I can tell you that although it has some benfits, topics are covered at such a high level and largely theoretical that it doesn't really translate into real world application

But more importantly, you have to to understand how data science emerged as a field in order to understand why a degree doesn't hold the same weight in industry any more. 

Most people who blazed the 'data scientist' trail were never intending to be data scientists because it didnt exist. Sure most of the time they pick up some useful skills either in their major or by themselves (stats, coding, etc..). They end up in a completely unrelated job role. They then had the idea that 'hey this job could be done better, let me see if I can apply some of this random coding or statistics I picked up"". And they do, and they apply it successfully. 

Next thing you know, you have someone revolutionizing the way that a process has been done by using data, statistics, and coding. This is incredibly valuable to a company, and despite what people think, companies (if successful) will lift up this kind of step change in success. Next thing you know that person is learning more, getting better, applying more complex techniques and reaping even larger awards from the company. And boom. Thats how you got this 'sexiest job of 20XX' and 'highest paid jobs' etc...

It has nothing to do with being able to explain SGD or predicting housing prices with accuracy in kaggle. It has everything to do with increasing the profit for a company bottom line. 

So when people complain about 'well I just graduated my program X and I cant find work as a data scientist' its because those lucrative jobs - which require experience and real world understanding - are being filled by people who worked their way there and are bringing massive $$$ to the company (its easy to justify a good salary when you have projects saving the company millions year over year). 

If you want an off the shelf job with your off the shelf degree. Then you start as a data analyst (which in many companies is the fresh out of college position in the data scientist family) and you work your way up. Alternatively you can spend your time figuring out how to apply data to whatever field you currently are in your free time to show your value.

&gt; If doing all that actually made any difference that would be great, but in actuality it increases your chance by like 1/10 while setting you up for miserable grind and burn out. For every one problem your business is trying to solve there's 100 different businesses who will scoff at your projects because they have different kind of problems, and yours are 'not real world enough' for them.

What a load of BS. Sounds like you're just not good at interviewing. The point isn't that your project is identical between company A and company B. EVERY company has different problems, data, processes, goals, etc... Hiring managers understand that. The goal in your interview isnt to say I did this and therefore I can do it here. Its to say: I had this problem, this is why I thought it needed to be solved, I considered things like a b and c, and then went with solution d. It was successful and I was able to change the way we did x. In hindsight I would have done y and in the future I may do z.

There is a reason so many companies place so much focus on the STAR method. It shows your thinking not necessarily your technique. And that, at the end of the day, is what makes valuable people valuable, not what they covered in their CS311 course."
"283","&gt;Sounds like you're just not good at interviewing.

This was my problem. I failed hard (embarrassingly so) at quite a few interviews despite having the technical knowledge. I revamped my approach, focused on my communication skills and finally was able to get a position. Soft skills can really make or break you. I'm still a fucking weirdo though so I may have just gotten lucky."

No one gives a flying shit about that. There's million people who apply for same positions nowadays, a company can search for their ""perfect"" candidate for year or god knows how long(and then hire someone another employee personally knows anyway), this by definition means 99.9% chances are against you, even if you're really great. That's why it's goddamn stupid to go spend months and narrow down your skillset to some super specfic stack/industry/position, HRs wet dream, just because you think it's gonna make you more employable.

Yes it will, by tiny margin, you'll waste shitton of time and energy in which you could've applied to 300 other positions or make connections in industry(congrats with your new tailored experience only 10% of those 300 jobs are now relevant to your experience).

I'm not saying you shouldn't do any projects, you have to, but focusing on sOlvIng rEaL wOrLD prObLEms and working for free for someone is waste of time, because 99% of the time you'll get dismissed for whatever reason **before** it comes to evaluating your skillset and projects.

&gt;Sounds like you're just not good at interviewing.

Lol if you actually look at problems the majority of people looking for job with no experience have, it's **getting the interview** itself. That's the whole point, doing countless projects or specialising will barely improve your chances to get interview. Make a profile on job site and say you have no official experience in field, link your github/protfolio whatever in cover letter and see how many people actually look at it before ghosting you. If it's even 5% I'd be super surprised.

Every company will also have their own way of dismissing your projects as playing with toys anyway(""oh you didn't make it for specific client/you didn't get paid for it/you weren't employed/it uses differnet stack/blah blah""). That's why you shouldn't do crap no one pays you for if you don't want to do it yourself. You should just apply to 200 different places and many positions and rely on your in person skills and networking, instead of relying on impressing some fucking neckbeard with your industry tailored project because it's not cool enough for him if he even ends up looking at it anyway.

I'm speaking from personal experience of trying to get a job as UX designer and spending shitton of time on various projects no one gave a flying fuck about in the end, because I didn't have job as UX designer before. Don't want any other poor fuck go the same way. I know it's motivating to think everything is in your hands and something you put your thought and energy into will give you the results but reality is 90% of hiring doesn't depend on you either way and you better invest this energy in networking."
"285","How often do you seriously look at people with a Business/Operations background rather than a software engineering or purely statistical background?

Is there a recomendation you can give me, since you are a profesional in the subjet and I am just a guy who want to learn by doing thinks in my work, but also contribute to develope our full potential (or at least make thinks better).

I would not mind if this turns to be a career changer and in the future I work as a data scientist or engineer in the civil engineering field."
"298","Here are some suggestions:

Find ways to collect, clean, and visualise the data -- I highly recommend https://r4ds.had.co.nz/ (R For Data Science) and David Robinson's ""Tidy Tuesdays"" videos [https://www.youtube.com/user/safe4democracy/videos] where he shows you how he does data analyses.

Realise too that sometimes there are big process changes which you can make to improve processes without necessarily needing to collect and analyse a lot of data.

The key thing is to get experience working with the data."

"301","Thanks for your input u/tl_throw, I want to move into the field in the next few years, so hearing from the hiring side is great for me. 

I'm self taught. Started with excel, then moved into access, and am OK at basic to intermediate SQL. I work with Tableau and Power BI and am picking up the scripting side of things there. I am working through codeacademy's data science career path (SQL, python, machine learning) and a tableau certification (need for work).   


I spend most of my time at work uploading csv reports from multiple departments to access, cleaning the data through SQL and my (extremely) rudimentary understanding of VBA. I work primarily with 4-5 tables ranging from employee data, to parking lot occupancy. A few tables are upwards of 16 million rows that I have to run analyses on and create visuals for slide decks and one-pagers for my boss. 

Formal schooling and I do not get along well, so going back for a DS or similar degree is out for me.   


As someone who looks at stacks of resumes, what advice would you give for someone like me to break into the data field in the next 2-3 years?"
"302","&gt; As someone who looks at stacks of resumes, what advice would you give for someone like me to break into the data field in the next 2-3 years?

The biggest thing is probably to learn R or Python (just pick one). The reason is that a lot of data science work uses these languages. SQL is very valuable as well but unless you have the programming skills in R or Python you will probably find it hard to get a data science position."
"303","I want to get into Data Science

&amp;#x200B;

Final semester in B.S. in Industrial Engineering

&amp;#x200B;

Currently interning at a local Aerospace firm

My job is simple Data Entry for Heat Treatment on Shafts, Bevels, and Gears

&amp;#x200B;

If I expand on these points more, is that something I can work off of ?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have to look for a job but idk where to begin"
"304","&gt; My job is simple Data Entry for Heat Treatment on Shafts, Bevels, and Gears

Do you have much opportunity in your role to analyse this data?"
"305","I do it on my spare time during work, like Lunch Breaks and stuff.

It's mostly done through Excel, I run a Regression Test, try to find any correlation between Parameters and Tolerances and how they relate to the next operation."
"306","Can you automate things? If you can do that, and save a lot of time, that's really valuable experience and it will look good on your CV.

However, beware the trap of getting too focused on the data at the expense of losing sight of what the data is telling you about. Data is just a tool to understand the world.

You also need to consider realistically whether anyone is going to change things based on the analysis you do / recommendations you provide. Sometimes processes or designs are so entrenched that you can't do much to change them, especially if you are an intern and you are there for a short span of time.

Are there areas of data science you're interested in long-term?"
"307","Yeah, I've looked for opportunities for that but I haven't come across any yet.

I can make a very simple data network, where one data sheet can talk to an other data sheet, update in real time, for a more productive workflow.

But as far as automating machines and things like that, no.  That's because with Heat Treat, it is 99% Manual Labor.  The thing I do best, however, is having people skills.  I'm not the type of person to just type in data into an Excel file and not understand what the numbers mean.

If the numbers don't make sense, I'll go on the shop floor, talk to one of the guys running the operation and get the back story on what happened that day and why this tolerance was over tolerance all in a friendly and helpful manner.

I've solved long lasting problems during my internship that way (I am talking about issues that have reoccurring for atleast 5 years) just by simply walking upto the Operator and ask questions.  Stuff like doing IT work for the operator because his desktop on his workbench is down, to simple things like teaching them how to send an email.  And that stuff is important because it's no secret that the older gentlemen are not as tech savvy as us young guys, it helps move action items further for an easier workflow.  In the most humbling way, I am the bridge that fills the gap between the shop floor and the engineering office.

I'm taking on bigger projects by helping the metal urgest, picking her brain on why certain operations are done for what reason, but like I said, so far the work is data entry with an Analysis on the side."
"308","I am interning at a logistics company this summer. Can anyone provide a link which provides similar to real-world datasets for practicing and playing around? I am sure they are present on the internet, but not able to find them."
"309","I am kind of the second person. Didn't have a formal degree in data science but I did join an online course to get me started and work on a side project by using real data I found online. Still, data I found online is still in good shape compared to what I found in **real-world** ie. my work. There really is more work to be done in cleaning the data to get them in nice and clean format.

I still wonder what master degree in data science offers though. Maybe Im missing something by not taking a formal degree?"
"310","Yep!"
"311","How do you know what people think makes them good at datascience. Where are you getting your data from? Why did you pick this two groups?  What data supports your problem definition. This looks like a hunch to me."
"312","To whoever is drawing any serious conclusions out of this post: this is one data scientist (one data point) telling you what the real world is like. Kind of funny (drawing conclusions from one data point....)."
"313","I have a specific definition of data scientist, which is those who develop new algorithms and means of accounting for signal and/or error in any type of model. A scientist creates new knowledge, so in my mind a data scientist creates new knowledge as it applies to data analysis methods. 

Everyone else to me is an applied statistician (applies existing models) or computer scientist (automates existing models)."
"314","Why is this post even allowed? So basically you say that doing kaggle challanges, online courses cannot be for fun or there is no noisy data at all there ? What. Also, based on what do you make this  assumption at all. Whats the data supporting your theory ?? Thats not very statistical lmao. I can state things As well out of thin air Jesus. Also you say that doing masters is not actually helping them, but participating at a school project is helpful. Wtf how are they not related xDD. Useless post imo."
"315","Deep breaths amigo"
"316","Ok :)"
"317","Hey 
 
Can you tell what difference recruiters see between freshers who come from statistics vs the engineers. 

I will complete my bachelor's in statistics this year and I am doing online course on DS and ML. Haven't decided about masters yet but just exploring statistics for fun."
"318","The key thing is: get experience working with real, messy data.
If you can talk about projects you've worked on where you applied your statistics knowledge, it will help you a lot."
"319","Thanks for your post OP. Can you suggest any particular books which give good statistical knowledge that we can apply to real messy data, and then the curated data we've refined?"
"320","&gt; Can you suggest any particular books which give good statistical knowledge that we can apply to real messy data, and then the curated data we've refined?

It's tricky because the first step is cleaning data, then once the data has been cleaned you can use all kinds of tools for statistical analysis.

It's hard to learn how to work with messy data from books - you need to learn that by cleaning real messy data. It's a bit like riding a bike. You could describe in detail how to ride a bike but unless I actually got on the bike and tried to ride it, and made mistakes and learnt from them, what you taught me about how to ride a bike would be too abstract. Reading about bike-riding is different from riding a bike!"
"321","I guess any good book recommendations for the ""all kinds of tools of statistical analysis"" you mention above would be useful."
"322","I recommend

""An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R"" by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani - available free at http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/

""R for Data Science"" by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, available free online at https://r4ds.had.co.nz/"
"323","Thanks for the suggestions. This thread has been interesting to read, including all your responses."
"324","I think what OP is actually stating...is that there is no book or books to read that can just miraculously help you understand how to deal with messy data problems. It requires taking a wide variety of tools and techniques and applying them uniquely to each problem. Thats the critical thinking part that is not taught in schools or books."
"325","Solution: Job hop.

Edit: Seriously it might explain why job-hopping occurs nowadays. A lot of people know their value in a technical aspect and recruiters can only really evaluate on these features. If I'm dependent on a blind manager to give me a raise, it may never happen despite the level of value you bring. I don't particularly enjoy garbaging about sports teams for the brownie points."
"326","Actually, job hopping is mainly driven by a different phenomenon - and that is that modern HR organizations make it impossible for managers to keep their best direct reports' pay and title at the level they deserve. So even if you *are* developing the relationships you need to develop, odds are the longer you stay at a job, the more underpaid and undertitled you are. It's incredibly rare to see an overperformer get rewarded at the rate they would if they just hit the open market.

I've had 4 jobs in my career. My average raise (including two promotions) is probably about 4%. My average salary increase when switching roles has been over 20% every single time. 

Now, the reason that companies don't promote people as fast internally as they do when they switch jobs is that they know a lot of people give value to the equity they have built inside a company - aka, the relationships they have built. Even if they are not getting you promoted, the fact that you have built a brand, that people trust you, that you know who to ask to get things done, etc., is valuable to people, and companies exploit that.

Is it a solution to avoid having to build relationships? Yes, but I think there's a ceiling. And that ceiling is likely going to be management - where in order to be successful, you eventually need to have developed those relationships, and where recruiters will look to evaluate your soft skills the further up you go. That, and it is difficult to get hired into e.g., Director roles without having been promoted into or from a management role before.

For context: when you evaluate individual contributors, one of your big risks is that the person doesn't have the technical skills to do the job. When you hire managers, your biggest risk is that they can't work with others."
"327","this advice will not be taken well by the introverts"
"328","I am an introvert, and yes - this was a hard pill to swallow.

However, the best way I've hear it said in another episode of the same podcast (paraphrased):

""As a company, we don't pay you to be ""you"" - we pay you to be effective. And if ""effective"" means talking to your boss about their dog, or the Marketing Director about the Dodgers, then that is what you need to do""."
"329","I worked at a company for a time where I was a very high value contributor. I delivered the data product for multiple deals worth 1 million+ and was directly involved in analysis and constructing arguments for regulators that saved the company's ass. I also was responsible for hiring and mentoring new team members though they did not report to me.

I was not the sales person or the person arguing in front of the regulatory bodies, however, I independently made all of their content as well as deliverables on very short notice often working overtime to get it done. I collaborated in many product planning and/or hand-off meetings and got along well with most people. We won every dispute and also made a ton of money--like \~10-20% more every year I was there.

I was not rewarded for this--my title and salary remained flat for two years while this was going on. Meanwhile the sales people and product managers were rewarded as if they were the people responsible. All I got was a ""we couldn't have done it without you"" and a few complements in front of the whole team.

Come to find out, our parent company seemed to refuse to promote engineers or data scientists at all. They treated us like a fixed cost--people that can be replaced. This was not the case for anyone on the sales, product management, or marketing teams. They were the golden children and were given VPs and directorships like candy as well as control over what we were allowed to work on on the data team.

All I was asking for at the time was a market-rate pay increase as well as for them to set my title at what it was, that being ""senior"". They refused, so I asked what I could do to make that a reality. They couldn't answer me, other than telling me they don't think we needed a ""senior data scientist"" for the business and that they thought I was compensated well.

I compiled a list of job descriptions from multiple other companies and pulled verified salary data from a variety of sources (for example H1B Visa applications) which proved them wrong. The role I had was a senior level role by industry standards and I was underpaid. They made a weak promise about revisiting it in a year only to fail to meet my expectations again, so I left.

Lo and behold not even 9 months after I left that place I was hired as a principal data scientist, which is one level of seniority above what I was asking for.

All that to say, sometimes you do work well with others, and also deliver big ROI on your skills, only to get shafted by management's stupid ideology about who is just a cog, and who should be in control.

The only thing I can think is that a lot of my work was ""head down"" by necessity, so I didn't have as much face time with others as I would have liked. However this wasn't my fault really as I had recommended more hires, or for us to slow down in some areas so I could focus on other things only to be denied every single time because of ""budget"" and ""revenue shortfall""--which wasn't exactly correct considering they had a massive profit margins.

It started feeling like the parent company was milking us for all we were worth to fund their expansion, yet nothing ever trickled down to us. We didn't get stock or extra cash rewards beyond our fixed cash bonus."
"330","There are two answers that I would have to this post - the legitimate one, and the argumentative one:

Legitimate answer: yes, relationships are necessary, but not sufficient for promotions. The same is true of performance - it's a necessary, but not sufficient condition for promotions. Ultimately, the organization needs to perceive your value as ""worthy"", and if the organization is not prepared to do that - or not competent enough to do that - then nothing in this world will get your promoted. 

Argumentative answer: the reason you did not get promoted is because you failed to build relationships with the people who mattered - those whose perception of your role determined your likelihood of getting promoted. That is, in order to get yourself promoted, what you would have needed to do is influence your organization over time to understand the value of an experienced data scientist. Alternatively, you should have leveraged your relationships to have other people help evangelize the value that you brought to the company - you should have influenced those same people that were taking all the credit to share some of it with you when discussing outcomes with key people.

Why is it an argumentative answer? Because that takes years, and the right course of action is to take a new job, get paid more, and not have to spend a bucket of sweat teaching other people why you are valuable.

However, it is important to highlight that if your company incorrectly fails to value your role, someone along the way has failed in building and effectively leveraging their relationships."
"331","I hear you on the argumentative answer. I've thought something similar. In fact I don't dispute the premise that relationships matter quite a lot--it seemed to be friends of upper managers that got all the promotions.

Unfortunately I got myself into a position where I had to be working long hours alone in order to meet the demands of the business. It wasn't really possible to loop other people in and still meet the deadlines. We had meetings and all that around deliverables and hand-offs, but figure I'd spend 30 hours a week with my head down in the problem.

I did make an effort to be in the office and socialize more but it was seriously hard balancing that, the work, and my family. Towards the end I had a surgery and it was like the nail in the coffin, people were upset I wasn't in the office more during recovery because they had a series of big company events to showcase this or that. I just couldn't meet their expectations at that time because my health wasn't good.

Part of that problem was management's fault in planning for the gradually increasing workload I fell into, however, I can't help but wonder what I could have done differently on my end. I used to hang out with a lot of these coworkers after hours for years like friends, but I also wasn't the life of the party.

I don't think my value to the CEO, CTO, etc. was in question given what they said to me, but they either didn't want me managing people or didn't seem to trust me to manage people even though I was mentoring them. I am not sure why. They never told me anything substantive when I asked for that feedback. I was asking for feedback all the time in order to figure it out and nothing came of it.

All in all, it's water under the bridge at this point. I do think my next area of focus for personal development needs to be on the relationship-side. I can see how our current executives use their relationships to get us funding, sales, etc."
"332","I think you landed on a different problem - you became too good at being an individual contributor to be worth the pain to promote you.

That is, if they promoted you, they would have needed to replace you. And that is a pain in the ass. So why not just keep you doing what you're doing now forever?

Of course, if they do that, they can't justify to any C-level person that they should pay you more - if you get promoted, it should be to do a different job. 

Again, the solutions here are far from simple. Part of what you'd want to do is to start leveraging being the ""expert"" to buy yourself time. That is, stop saying ""yes"" to everything, and start standing your ground and saying ""yeah, that's not going to happen by tomorrow - we'll need to make some simplifications/sacrifices"", and start building the argument for why you need someone else to help support you in this work - someone who you can then mentor/develop and eventually manage.

But again, this goes back to the same issue - at the end of the day, to change an entire company's perspective of your role is damn near impossible. You can work your relationships, but if you're not high up enough, what you would be asked to do is build relationships with people that you are not going to naturally build relationships with. So even getting in the same room with them could be a year-long effort - let alone have a relationships with them.

I had a similar issue at my last job, and again, there wasn't going to be a route for me to address that, relationships be damned, unless I was willing to suck it up for years - and given how in-demand data science is... yeah, I'm going to pass on that."
"333","Thanks for the advice, it's very helpful. Saying ""no"" is not my forte, one other thing to work on."
"334","I would say it's not as much about saying ""no"" as it is about not saying ""yes"".

Can you do this by tomorrow?

Bad answer: ""yes"".

Best answer: ""given the timeline, I would suggest we eliminate this portion, and make some simplifying assumptions on this one. If we can simplify the ask, then we should be able to have a really good answer by tomorrow"".

That is, you don't outright say ""no"", you just offer an alternate yes. Mind you, the person asking may say ""no, we can't change anything, it needs to be exactly like this"". If that's the case, then you have a couple of options:

Buy yourself time: ""That is going to be really tight. We can give you something tomorrow, but I can't guarantee that we will have had time to really pressure test the results, so we may have some exposure there. If this is something that is critical, can we maybe deliver preliminary results by tomorrow, but have a final revised version for (insert later meeting when people will actually discuss it)?""

The shot across the bow: ""Ok Bob, I'm going to have to pull all the stops and get all hands on deck to get this done by tomorrow. That means we're going to have to let Janet know that her request is going to be delayed, and we'll have to push off the (insert meeting name) till next week. Let me validate that with my boss and we'll move with that"". Or if it's just you and this means you're going to be working till midnight to get it done, something like ""Ok Bob, I understand how important this is, so I will make sure that this gets done tonight. It will probably hit your inbox late - 1-2am, so please review it as soon as you receive it and give me any feedback you might have"".

I call that the shot across the bow because you're making it clear that this is not something that you can pull consistently - you are at the very least putting some guilt into their side. Not only that, you're setting the table for the next time - since you were able to ""move things around"" to ""make things happen"", if the same situation arises again and you say ""Bob, we do not have the resources to get this done by tomorrow"", then Bob will be endlessly more likely to believe it."
"335","1. Domain knowledge

"336","Thanks. That seems a pretty exhaustive list. What do you mean by contextual knowledge?"
"337","Can they tell me what the business case for the stuff they're doing is, how that fits into a broader strategy, why it matters, etc? It overlaps with strategic thinking and communication skills and domain knowledge, certainly."
"338","Hmm... That surely is a recurring theme in most answers. Seems actual coding skills count for a lot less in the field."
"339","It's not so much that they don't count, I think, but that in a necessarily technical field, it's not too rare to find people who can write code...but it's rare to find people who can write code and do all of that other stuff well too. Granted, coding skill obviously isn't useless and in fact is something that we could all probably keep working on improving forever, but it's a baseline requirement for (much of) the work in the field.

The difference between a decent structural engineer and a great structural engineer is probably less whether they can build a bridge and more whether they can think very carefully about the project as a whole, how it might work with the resources they have, and whether there are pitfalls the textbooks didn't mention, or which the textbooks did mention but which most people forget. I think a lot of that mostly just comes with experience coupled with useful feedback and active work to improve."
"340","Pump the breaks on that.  Coding skills are absolutely 100% super important.  I'd rather teach a data scientist finance than teach finance guy data science. There's so many data scientists that can't pass a basic coding interview."
"341","Fair, but given the average coding interview, doesn't that mostly mean we need to do a better job teaching people how to reverse a linked list?"
"342","Personally, I don't really care for typical coding interviews for data scientists because they test different skills than the job function I'm interviewing people for. For entry-level, what I'm looking for is someone who knows enough about coding/software engineering practices that they can slot into and interact with a dev team producing client-facing apps.

My ideal interview process involves a technical assessment where I provide a lot of data in a similar structure to what we work with and tell the candidate that we want to see clean, well-documented code (usually in notebook format) exploring some interesting aspect of the data. I don't care what they choose or if they make incorrect subject-matter assumptions because there's no way most candidates know the field. What I do care about is if they can justify the analytical steps they took and write their code in a way that I can easily read and understand what's going on. People can learn more advanced stuff like unit testing and code optimization on the job, but if every loop uses a 1-letter control variable and there are zero comments that aren't obviously copy-pasted from someone else's code, that's a big red flag."
"343","Yea, there's definitely diminishing returns the further you go down the ""standard"" coding interview.  Generally it's useful to suss out an applicant's overall technical knowledge / exposure depending on the position.  Like, if you're a data scientist who claims to be an expert in python... well we'll find out quick."
"344","I am profoundly worried whenever anyone describes themselves as an ""expert.""

Like, obviously arbitrary metrics are suspect, but my assumption is generally that anyone who has not actively developed their craft in a specific field with particular tools over, say, ten years is probably not an ""expert."" Unless they're one of the only people in that field;  3 years after Python started existing there were a few Python experts, of course. 

You're right that ability to write good code can't be taken for granted. For all the bootcamps and resources out there, we don't do a great job of developing consistently good, clean, efficient, well thought out, well tested code as a standard practice/competency. Though some of that may be that it seems there's less likely to be as much mentorship or code review or testing in the ""Data Space"" as there is in the ""This product desperately needs to run well"" space."
"345"," Of course there is no clean code. Nobody is developing algorithms anymore, Everybody's just copy pasting. They know it works, They just don't even know how or why. There's so much entropy to code being produced and too little documentation- people don't realize that the way to code is on a notebook with pen and paper and that If there's more code than there are comments then your program is just s***. We are so focused on the speed at which we produce code That we don't even realize that producing code at such a speed is not agile. To produce code at such a speed is to make compromises and to make stupid decisions that are hard to revert And that makes for a very hard time for developers when it comes to writing code That is correct. They don't know the underlying data structure. They don't know how the language implements the data structures, They don't know How the hardware works in the slightest Nor do they have time to think of the big picture and foresee how the program needs to evolve and what the code base has to be compatible with in the future, where to remain modular, nor where to apply each coding pattern. The major problem is that developers know nothing of software architecture. They're literally people who curate code: they don't really know how to program.

What we have turned the profession into is basically human brain ETL of code from stack Overflow into the editors with very little room for critical thinking and planning.

Why do you think the author of the Agile manifesto said that Agile is dead? 

90% of a developer's time is browsing on Google to find the code block they need and the other 90% is browsing on Google until they find the exact reason it breaks on their scenario in order to 'debug it' a.k.a: copy-paste a tweak."
"346","Well to be fair passing what is now considered a ""basic coding interview"" gives essentially 0 insight into the candidate's quality when it comes to doing any of the coding you do as a data scientist or even as a software engineer. 

It's just a measure of how much they grinded leetcode or a roll of a dice for if they've seen that specific question before."
"347","Depends on the area, I work in geoscience, I absolutely would rather teach a geologist how to code than teach geology to a computer scientist."
"348","That's fair."
"349","Thats more than fair. Subject matter expertise is hugely valuable"
"350","Definitely, imagine being passed a project with no comments and no organization in terms of classes and functions... would be a nightmare to pickup where they left off"
"351","You asked for what makes an ""average"" DS vs a ""good"" DS. Being able to code in DS is pretty much a pre-requirement."
"352","Imo this whole list can be summarized as ""curiosity."" And it's my opinion that this skill is the most important. It doesn't matter if your undergrad/experience is in theatrical dance, as long as you're curious (self-motivation implied) you can learn anything. 

That said, when it comes to #8 (tech &amp; theory) curiosity really is what will set a DS apart. 

\- Do you have the motivation to teach yourself DS&amp;A? Seriously, data cleaning tasks can be sped up greatly by DS&amp;A familiarity.

\- You're trying to learn gradient descent but never took a calculus course, do you have the curiosity to learn calc 1-3, then implement the gradients from scratch to better understand how they work?

\- You need to use PCA, but are willing to put the hours in to understand what eigenvectors/values actually represent?

\- You're given a task in an unfamiliar domain, let's say real estate, are you curious enough about the industry to learn the required domain knowledge?

It all comes down to how curious you are. If you're the type who's just chasing the hype train, you'll lose steam while the truly curious ones outrun you. If you stay curious and hungry for knowledge, you'll eclipse your peers with impressive degrees from prestigious institutions."
"353","A summarized list would be useless. Curiosity is a vague concept."
"354","&gt; Curiosity is a vague concept.

This. We're interviewing this week and one of the seniors keeps trying to spike good candidates with this kind of intangible standard. In reality it's never about the candidate, the dude just wants to listen to himself.

Also the question is 'average' vs 'good', not 'good' vs 'great'. I feel like curiosity (as dude explains it) is higher up the totem pole from 'good'."
"355","Not a DS yet, but this is a good list. I need to brush up Eigenvectors though =3"
"356","Sir, I deeply appreciate your answer. Also I have question. What if I have less interest for specific domain? Cuz I have less interest in finance than other domains.

I just got employed as junior DS for the first time in finance domain. I'm getting overwhelmed by my peers with special degree and also by lots of domain knowledge to learn.

I'm self-taught DS with just bachelor in economics.

Curiosity takes me to job landing, but all of a sudden my curiosity starts to fade out as I get overwhelmed. And I met your reply. Thank you."
"357","Long term your best option is to change domains. Bioinformatics, healthcare, technology, etc. There are several industries to choose from.

As this is your first DS position, its important to successfully launch your career. Failure in your situation means moving forward without any professional DS experience.... Failure for someone more experienced might mean settling for a junior role, an under-compensated position, etc.

But for you, success here is key.... 

Personally I recommend staying in your position for 18-24 months (12 absolute minimum.) be hungry to learn, focus on modeling and methods, things that transfer to different domains. 

As for finance domain knowledge, listen to s podcast on your drive to work. Read the data driven investor (i believe thats the name).

Just be hungry to learn. Then after youve established yourself as an exceptional junio data scientist, switch roles to an industry that interests you more."
"358","Thank you for reply, I thoroughly read what you said. I'll keep your advises in mind.

Also I have last questions..

1. How DS&amp;A helps data cleaning? Would you mind give an example?

2. You mean 'The Research Driven Investor' by timothy hayes, right?"
"359","2. Yes

1. DS&amp;A come up all the time. Often youll need to define your own function to operate on SQL query returns, pandas columns etc. When you write a function, do you know how to evaluate its performance? Dont be the DS type where if pandas and sklearn cant do it, its impossible. Those people arent real data scientists, but they make it harder for actual candidates to get passed HR screenings. Those people are the absolute worst."
"360","Thanks! During this week, I've seen in production a bit of what you saying.

Like %timeit in jupyter to evaluate performance. Resources are scarce. I gotta learn DS&amp;A. Appreciated."
"361","Might be obvious and its just me not getting it - but what do you mean with DS&amp;A?"
"362","Data structured and algorithms. 
DS: Linked list, binary trees, general trees, heaps, graphs, etc. 
A: depth first search, merge sort, etc."
"363","Got it, thanks! 
And completely agree!"
"364","Finally a list of what makes someone a good technical something that doesn't make me feel attacked"
"365","Damn, I must be slipping. Normally I like to come at the rest of the world with a pipe wrench. Figuratively."
"366","Well...Im good on the sleep thing!

(Actually good on may others but can always strive to be better)"
"367","thank you for mentioning sleep. In grad school right now for Data Science and I'm making a better effort to get more sleep but its difficult when you are always so curious and excited to learn. Tips on how to get the mind off data science and actually sleep? I can handle the rest lol"
"368","Well, in my case, having 1 professor and 1 therapist tell me to get 7.5-8 f***in hours if it kills me helped

Real answer: I find that it helps to ask yourself ""what would I do if I wasn't worried (about time pressure, the next project, etc)"" and frame it that way. Turns out the answer is sleep more and work earlier but more consistently."
"369","Awesome list"
"370","Are these ordered? If not, what are top 3 in your opinion?"
"371","Not ordered, but I'm enough of an optimist to put ""willingness to put the work in to improve"" above most other qualities out there, for any skillset."
"372","I love that you put domain knowledge on top. I've come into companies with a high level of domain knowledge and it helps in so many ways. I think people with high domain knowledge can make a huge impact with just ratio approximations and maximizing them over time with several a/b tests that don't meet any necessary assumptions. I did this at most of my jobs before I went back to school for math (studied communication in undergrad, so no math from 2002-2017) and it was highly effective."
"373","In my humble opinion what a lot of data scientists lack is business context and understanding how to be practical. The best data scientists make the biggest impact, period. Even if you know everything about machine learning or can prove every statistical theory from the ground up, if you lack certain key skills you will never make an impact.

Since people don't often talk about this, I am looking to write a bit about it in the future but for now it is on hold. For me it's the number one mistake I see from poor candidates."
"374","&gt; The best data scientists make the biggest impact, period.

This is a relatively unpopular opinion here but impact is the only thing that matters. You don't rank people by how much input they use but by how much output they produce."
"375","&gt; This is a relatively unpopular opinion here but impact is the only thing that matters.

It should't be. The only function of a firm, or a group should be value creation. Now, value creation looks different for government, academia, and industry, but the underlying concept is the same.

If you have no impact, you are likely not creating value."
"376","That's very shortsighted and is the reason behind political maneuvering to be in charge of low hanging fruit with low risk.  A company is diversified and can afford high risk high reward plays.  People can't afford to be extremely skilled, work their ass off, and still fail because of things outside their control.  This means low impact and no reward.  Thus the dynamic I mentioned happens and peoples inability to afford the risk is passed on into the company that could.  Further, the suckers get put on the risky projects, making them more likely to fail.  

You should reward individual contributors based on how much they are bringing to the table, given the circumstances they are in.  But that's impossible since only a maximum of a few people truly are observing that. Thus you have an inherently broken system."
"377","I have always worked in small companies and had this narrow context in mind.

I tend to agree with your point in theory but in practice most projects I can think of are not complete successes or complete failures. Most of the time I think there is some value to be provided on the way."
"378","Agreed, personally a data scientist who is technically proficient but lacks basic communication skills/ common sense is a bad data scientists. Not to say they cant contribute, but half of data science is communicating to your business users and teammates."
"379","I feel like helps defining who the average data scientist is.

The average data scientist:

* Knows Python and/or R and is very comfortable training and evaluating machine learning models using existing libraries in those languages
* Struggles communicating with non-DS people
* Cares more about data science than anything else

I think those are the three prongs where data scientists can differentiate themselves and become ""good"":

* The specialist: has a broader skillset than just scripting languages, and therefore can help an organization by putting together more powerful solutions or tackling more challenging problems than the average DS.
* The talker: being able to communicate the value of DS is what actually allows DS teams to grow and find their place within organizations. It's not the value you create, but the value that people think you create and without this skill, your team is dead in the water.
* The business scientist: is able to drive business value using data science.

All teams need those three skills in order to truly mature. Without a specialist you'll eventually find yourself hinging your entire operation on shitty code deployed in shitty infrastructure. Without a talker, you will stagnate as a team because you won't get heads, budget, resources, etc. And without a business scientist you will just spin your wheels talking about what great technology you have, but will never actually deliver value to the organization."
"380","Your responses are always top-notch. Very well said. 

Now, what we're all trying to figure out in this thread is: am I average or am I good? Ha!"
"381","I dont think either of your second two points in the first section are negatives or characteristics of average data scientists at all. I think they are COMPLETELY orthogonal.

An average data scientist is someone who has a zero value above replacement skillset, whatever their focus is. Frankly, of all the things you could be good at, I'd argue your ""The talker"" is the one least likely to be a good data scientist if that is their primary skillset. Thats a DS manager skill; but many of us just want to be ICs.

I probably have a stilted opinion being right on the dividing line between DS and MLE where the main thing keeping me titled as the former is that employers want me to focus on NN architecture first, but I have never tried to hide that I don't care about anything other than ML and I look like that meme of Charlie Day when I try to explain ANYTHING, and I am paid sig. above market which suggests at least \_someone\_ thinks Im above average.

All that said as per usual while my perspective differs a bit I do think yours is valid and well reasoned. I just think there are other ways to succeed in this industry, especially once your DS functionality starts to branch out past UX research, A/B testing, client reporting statistics, etc. that actually involve client (internal or external) interaction and starts being more engineering adjacent."
"382","I have a few (and more, but I think I already typed too much). I'm sure many will disagree with some, but this is what came to my mind.

1) Understanding The Why

Perhaps this is the difference between a poor and average, but it's something I see at my workplace as a differentiator. I find the better data scientists (or any professional) understand why any given best practice and general guideline is used and know when they can and should consider breaking them. They can explain why any given action they performed was done that way because they've thought about it (hint: ""because that's how we always do it"" or ""because that's what my professor/mentor/... said"" is never the right answer). Better data scientists question everything and consider the pros and cons of various options. 

2) Statistics and Math Knowledge

I don't think you necessarily have to be the primary driver on your team in this area, but you should have a solid background in both and be regularly be challenging yourself to improve in these areas. I've seen a trend popping up (at least in my area) where people are getting ""data science"" M.S. degrees where linear algebra and multivariable calculus aren't even part of the prerequisites or degree program. Even people that have the background often seem to forget it after a while or at least get rusty. Stay sharp and keep learning.

3) Your job is to bring value to your employer

Your primary objective of any position is to bring value to the company. Everything you focus on should be bringing value (either directly or indirectly) and justifying your position. I'll often see what I consider average data scientists to lose sight of this and focus on things they find interesting instead of what meets the needs of the business (I think this is common in all scientists, but it's something to keep in mind). 

While skill building and exploration can be valuable they shouldn't dominate your time. Don't ask to spend months researching and implementing a new machine learning algorithm when a linear regression model would meet the needs of the business.

4) Communication with business stakeholders

I find that the better data scientists are almost always better at communicating to less technical people. In any setting you should know who your audience is and have a gauge for how technical you should be. Better data scientists can match the information with the audience, not just in terms they can understand but motivate it with why they should care about it.

5) Understand where you are in the process and ensure that you can integrate your work appropriately

I can't tell you how many data science products I've seen go to waste because they didn't establish a plan of how the final product will integrate with the business before starting it. Usually they'll ensure that they're building models and making predictions that WOULD be of value to specific users (e.g., asking other departments/teams if having a model to do X would help them), but they don't plan on how it would actually get used. Would it be an excel sheet? an API? a dashboard? Do the users have the skills, time, permissions, resources to access it? Can it be integrated into their other products they're already using?"
"383","&gt; linear algebra and multivariate calculus aren't even a prerequisite for a MS

Wut"
"384","Yeah...We have a data analyst that is finishing up a program like that and Ive had to interview candidates from programs like that. Their machine learning classes are entirely based on blindly tuning different hyperparameters in scikit-learn. 

I lead my departments data science team. I tried encouraging the analyst (who is in the same department and trying to do more data science work) to learn linear algebra and vector calc either individually or take a class at the local college on it as it would be necessary to do much of the work they wanted to do and to get jobs in the field. They assured me that data scientists dont need to know those things...I simply wished them luck."
"385","Seriously, that makes no sense. If you don't have a good handle on multivariate calculus and at least some rudimentary knowledge of linear algebra you're going to have a bad time. How do they even teach the probability theory and mathematical statistics courses in that program?

I should mention that I don't have a masters or PhD, but it's still mind-boggling that they don't require those courses. Those are undergraduate level courses and are vital to success. You can't build a good house without a foundation."
"386","If you understand derivatives/integration and matrix operations, you can be a more than capable data scientist. Thats like a week or two from what youd learn in several semesters of calc and linear algebra."
"387","I think someone with that limited of a math background may be able to do some data science, but theyd never be a good data scientist. They would have to rely too heavily on standardized packages and models and wouldnt be able to see when shortcuts could be made or when a custom algorithm would be superior."
"388","Here's a [medium article that sheds some light on that](https://towardsdatascience.com/becoming-a-level-3-0-data-scientist-52641ff73cb3) ."
"389","Thanks a lot. Have read this already. Looking for more opinions and details from the sub"
"390","Ah great! In addition to what the author mentions, I think being able to motivate e.g ML models to management &amp; a strong focus on key business objectives are what seperate a great data scientist from a good data scientist. 

Good data scientists may be able to explain ML models to other data scientists, but struggle with other teams. They are not always clear on how data science will impact the key objectives."

"394","I would say statistical knowledge, and knowing how to communicate results to a non-technical audience."
"395","Except I've literally had my investment bank client tell me yesterday to and I quote, ""Shut the fuck up, I don't want to hear about your shit data. Just fix it."" 

I was just in the middle of telling him it was their source system's ""shit data"" that was causing the problem and nothing wrong with how we were processing it. They've been operating like this for decades. ¯\\\_\(Ä\)\_/¯ 




^^^^Literally ^^^^have ^^^^lost ^^^^all ^^^^faith ^^^^in ^^^^that ^^^^institution."
"396","Start charging triple and just tell them what they want to hear. Fuck those assholes."
"397",".Edited this comment due to giving away some identifying info. All I'm going to say is it's not so simple."
"398","Isn't that part of knowing how to communicate results to a non-technical audience?"
"399","This is so important! I'm not quite a data scientist, I'm in a data management role with an epidemiology background, and I find I spend a significant amount of time with data scientists working with them to communicate results in a way that makes sense to non technical people :)"
"400","Level of engagement, systemic thinking that branches out into understanding implications on business and infrastructure (basically, have broader context), ability to sell the idea of data driven innovation. 

First 3 that popped in my head."
"401","Can you elaborate on the level of engagement aspect?"
"402","I'll put it in a question form. Are you just focusing on your current task, or are you willing to go and fight for your project?

I'm of course biased by my own experience, but more often than not - what makes a difference for your idea to lift off, is the persistence and notion that you need this project at least as much as your client."
"403","I find it kind of distressing that this thread is filled predominantly with technical answers. 

If I have to pinpoint the most likely success criterion among my colleagues over the years I'd say it's the ability to play well with others. The ability to accept your (even if current or temporary) ignorance and work with other people for our collective good is hands down the most important attribute. It makes you more hospitable, it ensures that domain expertise is shared with you, it allows you to leverage expertise in areas beyond your own, especially in business and development, and most importantly it makes you a fun person to work with. That opens far more doors than any technical skills will."
"404","Depth of knowledge.

While it's easy to get average results, going the extra mile will take a LOT of effort and knowledge. That extra mile very often makes a huge difference.

You see this all the time. On Kaggle, in Academia or even in the industry. There is a good attempt with vanilla techniques and then there is a huge gap and then there is some dudes with the state of the art where you'd need to have a PhD in that niche to be able to come up with it.

In my experience jumping that gap is what makes products ready for production use, what makes models ""almost perfect"" and so on. 

For example a project I worked on was NLP related and we were challenged to come up with something better than what they already had (some product from one of the vendors). One of the team members had a PhD in NLP and worked in NLP for over a decade. He came up with the idea of pre-training our off-the-keras-tutorial-shelf model with a carefully crafted domain specific dataset instead of the standard kitchen sink variety pre-training the vendors used. Our model ended up jumping the gap and blew everyone else out of the water. 

Plenty off projects I worked on where there was some guy that had plenty of experience with that particular niche (PhD's out of academia tend to have that) and due to sheer depth of knowledge was able to get MUCH better results than the rest of us.

My suggestion is once you got the basics covered, go very deep in one area. For example unsupervised clustering or association rules or small tabular data or big sequential data or NLP or whatever it might be."
"405","Ive often hear people say on this sub that a lot of companies prefer the quick ""average"" solution over the perfect one. And that people from academia find it hard to stop when they have an okey solution instead diving deeper and spending a lot more time on the same problem. 

 I assume that the average solution would be good enough when dealing with customer data or something. But in medical or technical fields they want more than average. Any thoughts on this?"
"406","Most ""data scientists"" don't work on stuff that ever goes in production. They're glorified data/business intelligence analysts. That's why most people care more about statistics than software engineering skills on this sub.

If you start working on things in production you'll notice that the real world is slightly different.

Simplest example I can come up with is that you don't have the whole dataset available in production. Data comes in all the time and it's not like you can afford to recompute everything thousands of times per second. Sometimes there are delays, sometimes some of the data isn't available and so on. Often the phenomenon you're trying to model changes all the time, it's not necessarily a static thing. Freshmen statistics (maybe even entirety of undergrad statistics) fly right out of the window at that point, online statistical algorithms is pretty complicated shit that I personally did not encounter in college.

Work these ""data scientists"" do rarely matters. Their analysis ends up on a powerpoint or a dashboard somewhere and as they discussed in the other thread, the higher ups will just ignore it if it doesn't match their current vision.

When you're working on production stuff, it usually has a measurable effect on something that matters. For example if you're A/B testing user interfaces, you might measure that the better interface leads to an increase in sales. Replacing A/B testing with a fancier multi-armed bandit might lead to finding those better interfaces much faster with a lot less ""waste"". If you're doing a recommender system you might find that improving the quality gives you a bump in sales that you can see in the charts with your own eyes.

In my opinion, if what you are working on doesn't matter then why are you working on it? I am baffled that people put up with shit like making reports that are then ignored. Why make reports then? Tell them to fuck off and go do something that's actually important."
"407","&gt; Ive often hear people say on this sub that a lot of companies prefer the quick ""average"" solution over the perfect one. 

""Perfect is the enemy of good""

In production environments you are beholden to deadlines and budgets which are pre-defined. Going past a deadline in some cases incur huge costs that your junior DS may not be aware of."
"408","Financial field wants the best because that 0.1% can still mean millions of dollars. 

In the medical field depending on application false negatives usually have to be 0 but that's more for actual testing and not ML."
"409","I deal with NLP a lot at work and I gotta ask (cas Im still very much new to the NLP world) how does one carefully craft a domain specific dataset? Was it something like USE combined with a manually crafted stop words list? Seems like a lot of manual effort and heuristic guess work (which is valid if it works lol)"
"410","I can give you an example:

In my industry, the consumers use a lot of slang terms, and come up with them fairly regularly. As a result, if we were to train an NLP model, it would be much better doing it on a large database of text specific to that community.

Reddit is actually pretty good for this, since there are things like pushshift that allow you to get large amounts of comment data from specific communities really fast.

So, if I were to be working for a music company, and I want to know generally impressions of various artists, one way to train the model would to be to pull text data from online magazines and communities associated to the genres the musicians work in."
"411","As a data scientist your main objective should be finding insight and communicating this insights to key decisions makers. Generally speaking, the business doesnt care what special technique was used. They only care if theres value in using your suggested technique. A good data scientist knows how to build great models. A great data scientist knows how to create value from good models."
"412","I think effectively it all comes down to having:

1. Good technical skills
2. Good soft skills

A lot of average data scientists have one and not the other - the best ones have both"
"413","Basically just soft skills...convincing other people to do things, understanding which problems to work on and which problems don't matter, knowing enough about the business and your discipline to drive PnL.  Same as any field or job description, really."
"414","I think this is already contained in other answers in different phrasing. For me an average data scientist will give the right answers to a question and a good data scientist will come up with their own questions. That means understanding what the product/project needs and actually caring about it."
"415","Someone who actually implements something useful business wise. The amount of Data Scientists asking for $200K a year when they have never achieved anything business wise is ridiculous. PoCs are not enough to warrant a 200K salary these days unless you're working on research that's complex enough for DeepMind to hire you."
"416","Probably not a great list. 

1. Actually eyeball the data. Junior/Average DS uses tools. The average ones are aware of the [Datasaurus](https://www.autodeskresearch.com/publications/samestats) but think a casual glance is enough. 

2. A Good DS (or any profession) is they know what they don't know."
"417","In my country good means average."
"418","Which country?"
"419","Does it even matter?"
"420","Skullfuck your country."
"421","All good data scientists spend a little time being average on their way to becoming good."
"422","I mean, it's kinda ironic to use the term ""average data scientist"" as something bad when we have no way of quantifying this average.

If everybody does good work than being an average data scientist means you're a good data scientist."
"423","maybe it will make it easier for you to understand if you replace ""good"" with ""better""."
"424","It's not a matter of understanding, it's just me joking about the irony of data scientists using the colloquial meaning of average on a conversation about being a competent data scientist."
"425","A few additions from me:

\- Not just application but also good understanding of the short-comings, applicability, etc. of each approach they may use for working with data

\- Ability to think end to end: Not just how do I solve this problem but also how do I know that I have solved it, how do I monitor/dashboard it, etc.

\- Better communication: Ability to explain the problem, the approach for solution, and results to both engineers that may be technical but not necessarily familiar with DS and non-technical audiences."
"426","* Communicating well, and tailoring the message to the audience
* Prioritizing work well
* Being efficient with time by not wasting effort on low-impact work
* Gaining trust of teammates
* Asking good questions to the right people often, in order to accelerate learning"
"427","A good data scientist can code and write tools to let you manipulate and/or visualize the data."
"428","To put it into a high level summary - if you can be just as skilled in; framing business problems, focusing on the end-user, communication &amp; problem solving as you are in the latest tech and tools you'll be a great Data Scientist.

"429","The best data scientists understand how to get buy in/funding and what it takes for the company to eventually adopt their model. 

Intermediate data scientists can build really cool stuff but isnt particularly useful. 

Beginner data scientists are just happy to be there and put too much emphasis on technical skills."
"430","Good DS needs to have sufficient technical depth in their domain, ie, know most modeling approaches and have DL skills to architect a custom solution if required. 

Good DS needs to understand the business application and should be driven by impacting the business and adding value (versus getting lost in the technical weeds and pursuing something ""cool"").

It's all about impact and you need these 2 things to effectively impact."
"431","Good data scientists can implement ideas quickly, document their findings and communicate well."
"432","What kind of average are we talking about?"
"433","Programming and systems knowledge. 

Ill throw this in because I havent seen it. Im not sure this alone makes you great, but even with advanced knowledge in math and stats, lack of an understanding of how systems work (hardware, software, file systems, networks, etc) can definitely slow your productivity and even limit what you can do with the resources available. 

Lots of challenging big data problems that people think require new fancy frameworks and tons of cloud resources can be done on modest hardware if you were only a better programmer and understood how your code hits the hardware.  

Especially if youre at a smaller firm and dont have dedicated staff to re-implement, deploy, and monitor your model."

"438","Is OOP required for front end fresh grad jobs?"
"439","Every fresh grad should have a good foundation of OOP principles. You dont need to be an expert, just know enough to be able to talk through different design considerations"
"440","Could you give examples about this? Like how would you show this in as interview?"
"441","You'll get basic knowledge questions like what is polymorphism or inheritance. You may also be given a scenario and ask you to design classes. In one interview, they asked me to ""design"" a chess board using OOP."

I guess on an embedded chess computer you are using c which is rather difficult if you want to apply oop principles."
"444","[deleted]"
"445","This is an aside, but:

I'm ashamed to admit it but I was mystified by the little C and C++ (yes I know the difference) I was exposed to in college (circa 2015) (and I guess I still am, because I haven't pursued anything in either of the languages since). I feel like the only reason I was able grasp programming in this era is because of the powerful abstraction modern languages provide. I'm mid 30s, and I remember thinking to myself after seeing some C++ in the early 2000s, that it all looked like hieroglyphics to me, and that I could never be a programmer.

Yeah, I know Java was around then. But this was all through my frame of reference and what I was exposed to. I thought it was all as confusing as that. Modern OOP languages make ""talking in programming"" (if that makes sense) much easier, both in learning environments and among others you work with."
"446","[deleted]"
"447","You could *probably* layer OOP on top of an actually-good chessboard representation with minimal runtime overhead.

(But, yeah, if I got this question I'd go low-level in a heartbeat. How many bits do we need per chess-piece? Four?)"
"448","Chess engines and chess boards are different things. Chess board with OOP sounds like a fairly good example to me."
"449","I wrote cross platform highly optimized C code. We very much used OOP principals. We had structs containing function pointers that basically worked the same way as C++ classes. We used separate C files for encapsulation. The only thing we didnt do was inheritance but we did prefer aggregation over inheritance."
"450","&gt; In one interview, they asked me to ""design"" a chess board using OOP.

2D Array of booleans, true for black square, false for white square is how I'd normally design it but since it's supposed to be OOP.

Object square, int variable for row, int varaible for column, a boolean called isBlack, and a String(?) saying what is on that square (""white knight, black rook, red checker piece etc."") with a blank string for nothing."

"455","When to use an abstract class vs an interface, inheritance vs composition, basic dependency injection, inversion of control would all be good to know, but maybe not expected."
"456","When *do* you use an abstract class versus an interface? They seem pretty similar. Like, in some languages I'd use the former and in some I'd use the latter."
"457","you use an abstract class when you have predefined behavior that you want to apply to all inheriting classes. you use an interface when you want to prescribe that the implementing class implements a method for you, commonly useful in IoC, or for dependency injection."
"458","I'm ~3 years I to my career and on my second job, and I don't remember squat of all those other than interface. I'm front end if that matters. I might be using some pattern while not knowing the name of it; just knowing how things work. But I can def see the limitations of not fully knowing the differences."
"459","If you dont know what pattern you are applying to the problems you are solving, then in all likelihood you are probably creating anti patterns."
"460","Some people have a decent intuition on this and experience teaches you what works and what doesnt... you would only know the names if you are more formally educated."
"461","Just because something works doesnt mean its NOT an antipattern. You can write all the spaghetti code you want, just because it works doesnt mean its quality or that it is maintainable. Using design patterns makes code easily understandable and maintainable. Using intuition as an argument against proper designs screams of someone who views software dev as an art (spoiler: it is not)."
"462","K"
"463","I learn the patterns from my senior so I doubt I'm creating anti patterns. I just don't know the names as the other comment said."
"464","OOP specifically shouldn't be required, at least not beyond a very basic level.  But, the thing interviewers are really looking for with OOP questions (which they often don't even understand is what they're actually asking) is whether you can logically analyze a problem and model a system that represents it reasonably.  That is very much a skill you must have... but that doesn't automatically mean OOP.  It's just that OOP is the common language we all generally speak in this field.

A good interviewer won't so much care if you can design a perfect object hierarchy with all sorts of polymorphic behavior and abstract classes and perfect interface design.  They'll care that what you outline makes logical sense and is a reasonable model of whatever problem they give you.

When I interview, my favorite is to ask the candidate to describe how they would model their computer's file system with OOP techniques.  I have no specific answer in mind, but I expect to hear things like a class to represent a directory, one for files, and maybe there's a collection of files stored in a directory, that sort of thing.  The specifics aren't important, only that it's logical and in the ballpark."
"465","I'm actually going to tell you how I'd do it, since I have already been doing some work on this problem for an implementation of 'FORTH' that I'm writing:

Firstly, I create a common superclass 'Node'.  This superclass has fields:

* 'Type': Runtime type of a node.  We will need to know what the type of the node is at runtime somehow if we can't 'nicely' assume it (we can't), and its good to avoid empty fields in the superclass that should belong in their respective subclasses.
* 'Next': Pointer to the node that comes after this one.  Since a file system is a search structure with a potentially unlimited number of nodes, we should have a way to easily iterate over them.  If every node has a 'Next' field, then we can at least establish a single linked list containing every node in the filesystem (but we won't because directories can give us exponential speedups (no exaggeration) due to making things into a tree-like structure).
* 'Previous': Pointer to the previous node.  Doubly linked lists are nice.
* 'Name': Name of / key for the current node.  Acts as a key for this specific node (makes more sense with files, which effectively have their value as their contents).  We can list all of these (tail) recursively or iteratively to show the nodes accessible as direct descendants of the 'current directory' (which is a useful construct that's probably too much for this post), or perhaps recursively through multiple directories.

Then, class 'Directory' is a pretty simple extension to this:

* 'First': Pointer to the first node contained 'within' a directory.  This is a pointer to a different node from 'Next', and is used for realizing a filesystem's tree-like structure.

Class 'File' is also a pretty simple extension to class 'Node':

* 'Data': A pointer to the (unfragmented, for simplicity) actual data blocks of the file from *on disk*.

I suppose that a semi-accurate way to explain this structure is to call it a recursively-nestable associative array.  It must be constructed using 'Name' fields since humans must be able to use this structure conveniently, and it should be tree-like so that CRUD operations can be implemented quickly.

This is all a much-more simplified example than a real filesystem since different real-world filesystems try to accomplish different goals.  Heck, these are only the *fields* that I've listed, and I haven't even talked about any of the methods involved, symlinks (including '.', '..', '/', etc.)), journaling, inodes, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**Obviously, filesystems can get pretty complicated!**

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I have been applying for about 2 months using websites like indeed, stackoverflow, and monster, and have gone to a job fair at my college (which I graduated from recently).  I have applied to \~15-20 jobs so far, and have only gotten responses from 2 of them (1 of which had a 1st interview with me on the phone, but didn't respond afterward, while the other just wasn't interested).

I've gotten help from a couple of people with formatting my resume as well, one of them being a very knowledgeable English teacher.  So, though I may be mistaken, I am not under the impression that there is anything inherently wrong with my resume.

&amp;#x200B;

**Could you help me to understand what I'm doing incorrectly so that I can present myself to employers properly and ultimately get hired, while show them that juggling concepts like pointers and data structures around is laughably easy for me?**"
"466","Well, you asked a fairly general question that I don't really have enough information to properly answer... but in terms of critiquing your answer to my question... the question is meant to allow for a lot of variation in answers, so when I look at yours, I don't see anything outright wrong per se.  You seem to be basically describing a linked list structure, and at the level of files and directories, I'm not sure that's how you would do it (certainly it would be when you get down to the block level).  On the other hand, I can't say for sure that you COULDN'T make a file system work that way.

So, as I said, nothing I'd say is wrong per se, and it wouldn't matter anyway because I'm not looking for a ""right"" or ""wrong"" answer.

What your answer tells me is that you have a grasp of data structures and that you can think things through.  You're fresh out of school at this point, and it seems obvious that you've learned well there, but now you have to learn to translate what is to a large extent the theoretical knowledge in your mind into real-world solutions.  It takes time for most people to learn that (and there's no one-size-fits-all answer to indicate when you're accomplished that either - always remember that a lot of this field is open to interpretation and differing viewpoints, it's not as rigid as other engineering disciplines tend to be, for the most part).

The only thing I would suggest considering is whether you're over-thinking things.

This is a common mistake for new developers I find because it's a learned skill to be able to simplify your thinking when you're starting out and have had schooling, but simplifying is a vital skill.  It's very easy to write overly complex solutions in this field, and that can be just as bad as writing outright bad code.  Note that I'm not saying you HAVE over-thought this answer, because that's frequently a debatable point... I'm just saying that learning how to step back and look at a problem and ask yourself ""is this the simplest possible solution that will work?"" is a skill that you have to develop.  Sometimes the answer is ""yep, this is a complicated problem and it necessarily has a complicated solution"", but oftentimes you'll realize that you've taken things too far.

This is important because one of the key things to being successful in software development long-term (and, for reference, I've been a professional developer/architect for 25 years now) is writing highly maintainable code.  It's something a lot of people don't seem to understand.  When you write a solution for a business, they want something that's going to stand the test of time and that they will be able to hire people to work on for a long time.  One of the best strategies for accomplishing this is keeping things as simple as possible because simplicity is easier to understand.  You have to remember that even if you're super-coder, the next guy that has to maintain your stuff may not be.  The more complex the solution is to begin with, the tougher it's going to be for them.

The only other thing I can think to say is that the amount of time you've been looking, the number of jobs you've applied to, the response rate, all of that, seems roughly right.  If anything, you may not be applying to as many positions as you can.  One mistake a lot of new graduates make is looking at job postings and thinking ""yeah, I can't do that job"".  Now, you have to be careful here because obviously there's going to be many that you really can't, but don't dismiss every job posting that seems beyond you because many of them actually aren't.  Many (most?) job postings are written by HR drones who just throw every buzzword they know into it, sometimes with ridiculously humorous results (like a recent post by someone who mentioned a posting wanting something like 10 years experience with Flutter - a technology that's existed for MAYBE 3 years!)  Apply for things that seem over your head a bit because the worst that can happen is you get turned down.  But, sometimes, you'll find that they actually don't need all the crap they asked for and will take someone less experienced.  Just be polite and respectful and don't lie when asked a question even if the answer seems like not a good one for your chances.  Worst you can get is a no."
"467","Yeah, that makes sense.  I'm getting some pretty strong 'Agile Programming' vibes from this.  Realistically, the simplest working solution would probably just be an on-disk version of malloc (though I shudder at the thought of using that seriously).  I'd also heard some things about HR people writing silly job postings before, so I'll definitely try to take them less seriously.  

Thank you for your thoughtful answer.  Guess I'll just keep chugging for now!"
"468","Just know when to make a function, both inside and outside of a class."
"469","Yes of course."
"470","If to you can create a class/module or two you should be fine WRT oop.

Can you understand the problem and requirements (clarifying questions welcome)? Can you find good (doesn't have to be strictly optimal) solutions to the problem and justify/compare them? Can you implement the solution? Can you avoid major bugs in your implementation or find and eliminate them? Can you explain some parts of the problem/implementation in interesting technical detail?

If the answer to all of those is confident yes then you are golden. If none of those answers is a clear no, you may have a chance."
"471","&gt; Frameworks are learned at the job and everything else doesnt really matter.

Can't tell you the number of ""entry level"" positions have required experience in stuff like Hadoop."
"472","&gt; Frameworks are learned at the job

God I hope so. I'm 34 and trying to greet a job that is a cut to my pay and vacation but which involves using frameworks, something that didn't really exist when I was in school and which isn't used at my current job. I just know that I need to learn again and if I stay any longer I only get more lost and trapped where I am."
"473","They wouldn't expect a fresher to know a lot. Here are some things I think would help you.

* Have a great attitude.
* They would expect you to pick up things quickly.
* You should raise any blockers or ask for help whenever necessary. You will need a lot of help initially. Don't think that they will judge you if you admitted you didnt know something. No one knows everything. 
* Make sure you don't  repeat the same mistakes. 
* Make sure you understand the requirements clearly before picking up a task. Have a discussion with your lead or PM if necessary. 
* Always test your code before pushing. Even if it's a  one line change.
* Make sure the happy flow is always working. 
* Always make sure you don't push unnecessary lines of code. Make sure you have clean, readable non duplicated code.
* Communicate to your lead if you need more time to complete tasks. Dont wait for the deadline to tell this to your lead. That can affect the next sprint plans. 
* They would expect you to complete the tasks on time.
* You should research on given tasks before you start coding. There probably will be an efficient way to do it which you may not have known. 
* Good googling skills.
* Make sure you understand what you code. Do not just copy paste from stack overflow. Try to have good understanding of the tech stacks you work with.
* Make sure you get feedback from your lead occasionally."
"474","The only things I disagree with: 
    They do expect you to pickup things quickly but its okay to make the same mistakes and if you feel a little slow while doing it its fine. 
     They definitely dont expect you to complete your tasks on time because the task is probably more complex than you think due to unfamiliarity with the code."
"475","&gt; Always test your code before pushing. Even if it's a one line change.

The more experienced I get, the less I do this

Bad qaisjp, bad!"
"476","^(*Slaps you on back of hand*)"
"477","&gt; Make sure the happy flow is always working.

"478","That's like the default scenario with no error or exceptional cases."
"479","I know Python, Java, and SQL btw"
"480","A) you should be fine. Also I assume you took C and Java if you've got a degree.

B) in a year from now, you'll wonder how you ever got away with saying you ""know"" anything. 5 years later you'll wonder how that kid with one year of experience ever thought he knew those languages. 10 years later you'll only know that you know nothing, and that it may simply be that it is impossible to know anything..."
"481","Not all schools teach java these days, just fyi, at my school the curriculum is mostly either C++ or Python, the only classes that use Java have the word in their name."
"482","[deleted]"
"483","It's interesting how you've assumed T-SQL is the default. SQL is a widely known standard, and IMO if a resume has that keyword but no other hints it would be a misstep to make any assumptions about server side logic like plSQL/T-SQL."
"484","Yeah Ive been doing software engineering professionally for 10 years now and had no idea what T-SQL was until I googled it"
"485","when i was a new grad in Cali I got grilled with leetcode easy's and just simple questions about fundamentals of OOP. 

I didn't even realize at the time they were LC easy's. I used mostly brute-force solutions that were garbage and I did fine."
"486","I have a question for you, if you don't mind. I'm currently in my last semester and I've been thinking about applying to a Microsoft job listing for software engineers. They're mass hiring entry level devs. Thing is, one of the requirements is 1+ years of experience. I haven't had any internships or work experience but I do have some projects and I'm fairly comfortable with most of the other stuff they're asking about. Should I apply?"
"487","Apply. Most likely they won't even interview you but you may get lucky. if you dont apply you def wont get an interview."
"488","That makes sense, thanks."
"489","[deleted]"
"490","This is the main thing that's worrying me, my resume being nuked by a filter before it gets to anyone."
"491","Worst case scenario, you won't get the job so that's the same as not applying.

Thing is, if you are not really lucky you will have to apply multiple times until you get an interview and then probably some for an offer. I've been looking for a job for the last two months, all but one were rejects, some just after looking after resume, some after sending them the task but you will find a job eventually.

Good luck!"
"492","No, the worst case scenario is the job fairy reading over his resume and being so annoyed by it, beats him with a sock full of nickels in his sleep."
"493","Yeah I think I'll just go ahead and apply. Thanks!"
"494","One thing that helps is reaching out to a recruiter on LinkedIn and just tell them something in the line of ""how you applied and never heard back, but you're still interested and would like an opportunity to interview with them"". It's not guaranteed but I have gotten a few interviews through this approach."
"495","Microsoft definitely asks Leetcode questions. For me, my first application to Microsoft took 9 months before they got back. So, get into the system!"
"496","Wait what? Really? I'm a college freshman and I applied to their Explore Internship around mid September but never heard back. Not a single thing.

I do realize it is way too late for them to reach out to me for an internship but I guess it can take several months long before they reach out to you?"
"497","It can. However, there may be cases where they get back to you fast. Many top companies can take months or even years before they get back

Also, it's reliant on hiring waves. There's one around January through March, one around June-July, and one later in the year. I tend to do horribly around the Thanksgiving one"
"498","I got asked a leetcode hard for a MS intern interview. Definitely be prepared"
"499","I've started working on some lc easy's and I'll work up to the rest. Thanks for the advice!"
"500","when did you start applying to entry level roles?? how soon before graduating?"
"501","Most of my classmates started applying beginning of fall semester for a spring graduation. The good students got job offers before winter break. The bad students got jobs in the month or so before graduation."
"502","Then Im a horrible student. Graduated with no job offer."
"503","I'm speaking very specifically and anecdotally about the people who graduated in my program/year, not anyone else. I'm even only speaking about the ones I knew well enough to both know their plans and have an opinion on their abilities. It's not a formula."
"504","Im just messing around haha, I understand you."
"505","Some people start applying the semester before their last semester, and in general, you should try to begin applying at the beginning of your last semester at the latest.

Sometimes the interview process can take months so this is a good way to ensure that you have a job lined up after graduation. If you start now you should be safe."
"506","Brute force solutions are good enough 50% of the time. Something people wont tell you lol"
"507","&gt; I didn't even realize at the time they were LC easy's

This was my problem starting out as well. Nobody told me that it's somewhat like a standardized test ( *ducks and covers* )"
"508","it IS a standardized test. and like most of those they arent that useful as a measure of what they are supposed to be measuring (coding ability), but you have no choice but to face them to get into the places that use them"
"509","What is OOP?"
"510","object oriented programming"
"511","I think the biggest thing is the ability to learn.  Knowledge of programming languages, frameworks, etc., is helpful, but anyone can learn a different language easily with good knowledge of OOP.  You'll probably have to have your hand held for some time during your first jobs, or even first few jobs maybe.  Having some skills is useful but definitely emphasize your ability to learn, because every company does some things differently."
"512","Start looking for jobs now, just have your graduation date on your resume. 

I expect ds&amp;a type knowledge in addition to a fairly strong familiarity with any given language. Obviously if I'm looking for a C developer, being familiar with C is a huge plus. I'd definitely consider somebody who feels very confident in Java and had used C a bit as well though.

Transitioning from one language to another isn't the end of the world. So yeah, basically show off what you can do in your best language. To be clear, these are my expectations for a new grad."
"513","What do you consider strong familiarity as, with Java for example? Grading myself, and knowing what I should be learning to be useful has been difficult for me."
"514","Oh boy. That could prove difficult. Instead of looking at it that way, my point was simply ranking how experienced *you* feel you are in each language. The takeaway here is that you don't necessarily need to be very strong in a specific language, provided that you're strong in *a* language."
"515","That's fair. I have an Associate's degree where I focused on Java and similar languages. But since then I've had little time to build on my knowledge or watch videos and I'm not quite at the level where I can lurk around on posts and understand even half of what's going on in them.

I'm not sure if it's me, or if I'm just not finding resources that fit the way I learn things. I've thought about internships, but they all want Bachelor's degrees and experience and I'm a crap at discerning when a posting is exaggerating or what I can do to be considered.

This post is probably one of the only posts I've seen on this sub or similar ones that didn't consist of ""never give up!"" or FAANG something or other."
"516","Programming to me was one of those things which I really struggled with at university, I couldn't grasp some of the concepts and I didn't understand what I was really doing.

So I was super nervous when interviewing but when I got my first job though my rate of improvement shot through the roof, everything started clicking together, a couple of years later it was basically second nature. I'm now 10 years in and it's something I still enjoy."
"517","Yeah I definitely think on the job training would be a lot more useful than strict classroom learning, but I understand why companies don't exactly jump on that train.

I recently realized a better metaphor for classes that helps me understand is to see them as factories, rather than hierarchies. You program how it produces and make objects from it. I dislike the hierarchy analogy because you neither change nor produce anything from a classification like ""animals can be dogs or cats""."

"554","Attentive persistence. Keep trying to get things done you are assigned. Know when to ask for help, too often you become an annoying burden to some people, not often enough, you waste time trying things that are never going to succeed.

Be mindful of others' time. Don't have meetings when an email could suffice.  Don't ask people questions every 15 minutes, ask them twice a day, bundle up your questions to only interrupt them once.

The most difficult thing for software pros is trying to find multiple hours of uninterrupted time to get into deep focus into what you are doing. Every interruption pulls them out of that focus and have to start over their thought process. Set up 15-30 minute meetings on their calendar immediately AFTER other meetings. If you set it up before, you may be making it difficult for them to prepare for the meeting, but that still may be okay, use your judgement.  If they have a block of time from 2pm - 5pm open, do it at 2pm, not at 3:30pm which would trash their focus in the middle of a 3 hour stretch.

Good communication skills, that you can share ideas clearly, both to other technical people and the business-type people who don't speak Python, C#, or JavaScript.

No ego. People early in their careers especially feel they have to prove themselves. Do it with your actions, not your words."
"555","Social skills. 

Seriously. You will be more likely to get the job if you seem like a good person to work with.

Obviously your technical skills will need to be up to scratch, but showing the interviewers that they're not going to hate you after spending 8 hours a day, 5 days a week working with you will go a long way.

&gt; Also, when do graduates usually start looking for post-grad entry-level jobs?? Is now too soon?

Never. As you expect to graduate, you can apply early. There are hot months and cold months when it comes to when companies search for candidates. The top tier companies do not adhere to the recruiting schedules, but the reality is that you might have to gain experience at other places. 

Even if you are graduating a year from now, you can go to job fairs and ask the recruiter what they are looking for. They might not know, but at least you might be able to get a job description

Try to pace yourself. Also, some consulting companies are absolute shit. If they miss a phone call by more than 10 minutes, start wondering if you should keep talking to them. Make an Excel sheet of places you applied to both via contracting and full-time. 

ESPECIALLY keep track of which contracting companies got you any interviews and which ones have been a pain in the ass. Feel free to ask the recruiter if there's a homework assignment. I even ended up being asked to solve a mess that THEY created, and luckily I realized that I should nope out of ever talking to them ever again

The job hunting process can be stressful as hell. If a consultancy is causing you a lot of stress (example: continually missed phone calls/too many cold calls/they call you an hour late), dump them. 

I found myself having to micromanage recruiters, and realized that the ones I have to really micromanage usually end up not being worth it. Companies need to realize that recruiters are a face of your company. 

If you ever have worked with the likes of a Google recruiter, holy shit. It feels like they rolled out the red carpet. They are easy to get a hold of. They talk you every step of the way, and they are incredibly considerate.

For skills, a lot of the times, it'll be in job descriptions. There's also many hints about the company in the descriptions"

"568","Depends a lot on the company you're applying to. I've had some really simple interviews with LC easy, basic OOP, and problem solving. 

I felt that some of the interviews in the Bay we're honestly a little insane. LC Mediums / Hard + MapReduce system design questions + distributed system questions around concurrency, edge case handling, system failure handling through data and application redundancy. This was definitely material not taught in class and definitely required serious outside study to answer to a decent degree. I had interviews were I answered everything optimally (albeit a little slower than I would've liked) but didn't get the job.

The answer is that it varies."
"569","In an interview:

* mostly basic LC medium level type questions.

* communicate about what your overall approach is and what you're doing. If you ace the entire question but refuse to speak, you will probably get a weak yes. If you do not ace the question and refuse to speak, you will probably get a no. If you do acceptably on the question but communicate extremely well in a way that leads me to believe you know what you're doing and are on the right track, you will probably salvage at minimum a weak yes. 

* comments and unit tests in an interview are not necessary to me, but if you do them and still have time to finish I will be impressed

* OTOH, I *do* expect code to be well-factored, variables to be appropriately named, use functions as necessary, etc. Non-native English speakers in particular, this may be a place to improve. I beg of you, do not write your variable names in pinyin and then comment the Chinese characters.

On the job:

* basic terminal usage. It always amazes me when I hear about somebody in an interview or on the job who doesn't even know how to open the terminal. I'm not asking for anything fancy, just the basics.

* git or other version control. Again, nothing fancy, just the basics.

* ability to complete basic tasks with minimal assistance. Obviously there is ramping up on a code base, but you shouldn't need spoonfeeding of every minor step.

* communication skills. Communicate project status to the team and boss. Communicate blockers to whoever they're relevant to. Coordinate features with other teams that may own the part of the code base you need to change.

* ability to attempt to proactively problem solve. Did you Google it, search stack overflow, search the internal knowledge base, look at the code, talk to owning team, etc or do you have to run to your boss/tech lead any time anything goes slightly wrong?

* a database technology of some type, generally SQL. Nothing insane, but ability to write basic queries, some concept of database design.

* a statically typed language like java/c

* a dynamically typed language like Javascript, python, or ruby.

* ""Coachable"". Ability to take criticism positively and improve.

* motivation to learn and expand their role."

"572","Be able to code, knowledge of fundamentals, especially data structures, and interest in learning. That's it, nothing else. Especially not knowledge/experience with specific languages or tools.

"573","Are you a good friend? Can you project that to a group of random people in an hour? This may depend on what type of team you are looking to join, but it was really important that we like the people we interview.

"575","I'm also graduating in May and I started looking at jobs around October, although I haven't started to actively apply until mid-January. I've been invited to the final onsite interview for a couple of companies so I think I have some advice I can give.

What I found is that showing genuine interest in a company and just being an overall nice person goes a long way. Asking questions specific to the company and/or your role shows interest. Also, admitting when you don't know something (but can reasonably logic it out) is much better than flailing around pretending you know it. Knowing how to think out loud is always a plus. Repeat the question and ask clarifying details if necessary. I think it also helps to have a trail of personal projects so companies know that you like learning new things and are a 'self-starter' (ugh, I hate that word)

In terms of technical skills, I've been asked about SQL queries, OOP fundamentals, some leetcode problems (easy/medium? I don't do leetcode), memory management, and also some case studies. They also ask about any internship experiences or anything else you've done (quantify your successes if possible). Behavioral questions I've been asked include 'Tell me about yourself', 'Why do you want to work here', 'What's your greatest strength/weakness', and 'Where do you see yourself in 5 years'."

If the job title I was interviewing for said junior that's what I would ask. I used to fish for more knowledge basically for fun, but that backfires on the candidate when the manager who in the room who doesn't know things hears they don't know things.

You're going to want to apply at a larger company, not necessarily google(I mean give it a shot for lols why not) but something like accenture or generagl dynamics size/level; big but not a meme. Small companies with like a handful of devs don't have spare train junior spots/money. One of the things that keeps junior spots existing is seniors wanting them as almost a job perk/benefit, if you get a competent one just right and actually train them some you can totes pass what's annoying boring shit to you off onto them and they'll love it."
"577","Have 10 years of experience as a React developer /s  

But seriously, entry level implies that you have a sound understanding of basic design patterns and software engineering best practices, and perhaps have a basic understanding of things like SQL or NoSQL, testing, that you are curious and willing to learn, that you are willing to fail gracefully and learn from mistakes, that you can take direction from senior devs and not spin your wheels too long when you encounter a blocker, and that you have good work ethic."
"578","Really try and master OOP, DS, Algorithms.

Be comfortable in plain SQL. Select, Insert, joins, upserts, subqueries...

Bonus points, learn a framework complementing the language you're good in and demonstrate comfort in that framework. Build a demonstration showing off that you know it.

How to interview: keep going back to your small projects when answring questions. Lean on it, as it's the only real experience you have.

Once you've got all the above, I would prep for interviews. Grind leetcode so you can pass OOP, DS, Algos. Yeah people hate it, but only morons would deny it's the primary filter for hiring. Don't waste the few opportunities you have to get an in person interview by blowing a coding assessment. Be smart and maximize your on-sites where you can lean on your projects."

"583","I hope I find someone like you when the time comes for me to start job hunting. Honestly, some of the stuff people have listed in this thread as requirements for entry level (excluding the people that are obviously joking/exaggerating) is still too much for me. Seriously, if these are the minimum requirements for entry level I'm likely fucked.

Then again, I'm not locating near silicon valley (I'm in Michigan) and I don't hope to work at a big N. Not that I wouldn't like to, I just don't think I'll ever be that good. And if I am ever that good, it would be after years of experience at another job which I'd have to land first.

Things of concern in this thread:

* Design Patterns (vague statement, what does it even mean to know design patterns? There's 20+ of them in the Gang of Four book and hundreds of other ones like MVVM, MVC, JavaDAO, etc. Unreasonable request for entry level devs imo)
* Mastery of DS &amp; A (vague statement to begin with as there's hundreds or even thousands of well-known ones. Also, to me mastery implies being able to implement them yourself. Seems unreasonable unless you're trying for Google or something) To be clear, I think it's reasonable to expect a basic understanding of the fundamental data structures and algorithms such as binary search, stacks, queues, trees, arrays, lists, hash maps / hash tables, etc. But not mastery, just the basics of when to use them and SOME of the advantages / disadvantages of each.
* Git/GitHub basics being listed to include things like rebase and merge. I think it's reasonable to require a basic understanding of Version Control, but I don't think basic includes things like rebasing and merging. Basic to me is init, commit, push, pull, add, remove, commit messages, create a repository, clone a repository and configure your username / password.
* I think it's reasonable to expect a basic knowledge of SQL and databases, but asking for things like upserts (which I've never even heard of after obtaining an AAS in CS, using SQL in Java, C#, and taking an SQL CLEP class for BSCS) is unreasonable and some joins is even pushing the boundary between intermediate and basic imo. Basic to me is SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE TABLE, CREATE DATABASE, DROP TABLE, PRIMARY KEY, basic conditions such as WHERE statement and basic concepts like subqueries.

I think it's reasonable to expect entry level devs to have a GitHub account with some very basic personal projects on it, for code samples if nothing else.

It's also worth mentioning that I was definitely one of the best and most knowledgeable people in every class I took throughout my CS program at my local CC, so I think companies are going to be hard-pressed to find people to meet most of the requirements in this thread if they're truly entry level. Obviously you're getting this from the perspective of an unemployed CS student from a non-ivy league college, but I have been programming for about four years and most of what I'm reading in this thread scares the shit out of me."
"584","&gt; Honestly, some of the stuff people have listed in this thread as requirements for entry level 

Are nonsense.  Don't worry.  Almost nobody can meet these requirements.

[You read the book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns).

`Design Patterns` just isn't that big of a deal.  It's super OO oriented and, in most real world cases, companies aren't very OO.

"585","Personally I would not be able to just read that design patterns book and be able to say in good faith that I know those patterns. Knowing the patterns to me means being able to implement them, not just knowing that they exist. That would take a lot of time and practice in addition to reading the book, at least for me.

Also it was not my intention to brag. I attended a no-name community college so it's not like doing well there means anything. I said that to illustrate the point that, if I'm among the top of my class and, by this sub's standards I'm not even fit for entry level, where are employers going to find these magical ""entry level"" candidates that are experts in everything?"
"586","&gt; Personally I would not be able to just read that design patterns book and be able to say in good faith that I know those patterns.

It's not actually the patterns that you're supposed to learn.  It's what a pattern is and how it's used.

Again, though, this is a false flag.  Of the ~90 developers in my office, best guess five of them could even identify half of the design patterns verbally by title

"588","They look for enthusiasm.

They look for the willingness to learn new things and the ability to learn fast. 

And finally they expect you to be able to solve well-defined problems, e.g: translate this mock into front-end code, write some code to implement a certain feature that's already well defined with certain tickets. This is opposed to more senior roles where they expect you to take more ownership and also solve more ambiguous problems like ""make the app perform better""."

"594","As a new grad most companies aren't going to expect you to know it all.  When I'm interviewing someone that's new out of school or only has a year or two of experience these are some of the things I look for:

* Communicate well: be honest, humble and don't bullshit.  Most of the people that will interview you have been doing this longer than you and can see through your bullshit a mile away.
* Be enthusiastic.  There is a crap ton going on in software and IT.  Read, learn and be able to talk about something that's going on that excites you.  I always ask folks, 'What's new that you are into?'.  I honestly don't care what it is I just want to see a person be pumped up about something and take the effort to learn more.
* For whatever you are applying for understand the basics.  If it's a front end developer, do the introduction for React and build a couple of apps.  Be able to communicate that you understand the basic concepts.  As a beginner no one excepts you to know it all.  Being  able to talk the basics, and well, goes a long way for a new grad. 
* Some of the deeper concepts you learned in school may not apply initially.  Chances are no one is going to quiz you on OOP.  They are going to ask you questions on NodeJS or Python.  Understand what you are applying for and focus on that (see previous bullet)
* Good luck and keep your chin up.  First job is the hardest but you'll get there!"
"595","Here's an answer some people in the sub won't like:

Companies (usually) aren't hiring computer scientists. They're hiring developers. The best developers aren't writing whiz bang code, pushing their languages to their limits, with code that's optimized to the gills.

They write code that is easy to maintain, easy to extend, and are mindful and knowledgeable of the business their code supports. Knowing how to be a better developer is great, but means nothing if you know nothing of the business you work in. Scott Adam (creator of Dilbert) says it best:


""If you want an average successful life, it doesnt take much planning. Just stay out of trouble, go to school, and apply for jobs you might like. But if you want something extraordinary, you have two paths:

1. Become the best at one specific thing.
2. Become very good (top 25%) at two or more things.

The first strategy is difficult to the point of near impossibility. Few people will ever play in the NBA or make a platinum album. I dont recommend anyone even try.

The second strategy is fairly easy...""

In the world of software engineering, this probably rings more true than any other field of work. If you work in finance, pick up books on finance. If you work in ag, pick up books on agriculture. Be an SME on what you work on. Don't live in a bubble."

"597","Ability to learn, do various tasks you probably wouldn't think of being expected of (helping out the QA team with various tasks, maybe manual validation, helping DevOps with various tasks to understand the automation pipeline), showing initiative.

As an entry-level employee, you won't be doing any design, architecture and maybe not even much development at all at first. You'll be doing testing, automated testing to understand the product and how it works and what can be improved.

If you show enough initiative, you'll get more responsibility and some development work as seniors and management gauge your ability. My first job started off at QA (mostly automated testing, writing my own scripts), then the architect realized I could be way more useful going right into development work. But that was only because I developed tools to make the automated process more efficient (showed initiative)."

"620","&gt; People can go on and on about how to endlessly grind algorithms yet somehow think social graces are some innate trait that you're born with or not.

People who have social anxiety don't automatically have bad social skills. People just think they do because of anxiety. Anxiety is just fear.

The social skills are what we learn from our parents. People who have them are not aware that they picked them up from their parents.

People who didn't pick them up, have a mountain to climb.

"621","Well, no, I really didn't have the skills at all. I couldn't talk to family members let alone strangers. I was really quite shy even into young adulthood (20-21). This is not the social anxiety, simply a better picture of my great communication skills.

"628","&gt; A good technical communicator can summarize the same problem for me in 10 minutes.

Technical communication is not a separate skill from understanding technical matters. If you understand the technicals, then you can communicate it.

Never have I had a co-worker who could understand code, but couldn't communicate it. If the person can't communicate, then they don't understand what they are attempting to communicate about. The two skills are one in the same."

Youre basically saying that public speaking and technical skills are one and the same, which is obviously wrong."
"630","&gt; The classic examples are things like explain recursion to someone who isnt technical.

If you can't explain recursion in 5 words (A function that calls itself), then you don't understand recursion.

The act of understanding something is to come up with words that explains that concept to yourself. If you can't explain something to yourself, then you don't understand it. If you can explain it to yourself, then you can explain it to someone else.

&gt; You can also understand a concept and be really bad at organizing communication in general.

I disagree. If your thoughts are too disorganized to communicate, then they're too disorganized to understand the concept in the first place.

The only reason why people think it's a separate skill is because it's taught in schools as if it was a separate skill. Everybody thinks they have bad communication skills when they're in school because they have such a terrible time at public speaking class. What those people don't realize is that after they graduate and enter the real world, they start to formulate opinions of their own, which are very easy to talk about. When you're in school and are forced to give a speech in front of the class about Moroccan history, or some other subject you or no one else in your class cares about, of course you're going to think you suck at public speaking."

- people that are perpetually late

"645","No. Its not about making small talk or not, its about extreme social awkwardness that usually determines rudeness, complex of inferiority/superiority and so on and people are forced to tolerate this attitude (because hey, we dont have enough people in this field in general and cant afford to reject ones for the reason of soft skills). 

Being able to communicate, to establish a decent relationship with coworkers, to give a basic presentation in front of a few people or to work in teams without freaking out is essential in every job. 

Its wrong on so many levels to encourage people to stay like that and to promote this field as being the heaven for socially inept persons. Those aspies can very well learn basic social skills with good therapy and practice, given the fact that they are not retards and can acquire soft skills just as they do with technical skills. As far as I know, nothing related to their medical condition (if they even have one) stops them from having a normal life. 

Yes, I understand they are introvert people in this world who will never be social butterflies, but thats not the point. Many programmers are simply very difficult to work with and its sad.

"657","So, who do you think would get picked to lead projects or testify before the Senate on the value of STEM R&amp;D funding?"
"658","Again soft skills are super important; however, the best candidates have both good soft skills AND good technical skills. For the most competitive jobs, one is not enough."
"659","for more senior roles soft skills are way more important than technical skills, eg for a role which has a lot more collaboration between teams, multiple people, leadership, technical skills fade into the background"
"660","Technical Skill are overemphasized because they are overvalued. I see companies hire folks who aren't at communicating, into upper level management/architect positions. It happens quite a bit. When you make it past the interview stage, it ain't all sunshine past that."
"661","If any companies actually did require Einstein level technical skills, I bet they would be a lot more flexible on lacking soft skills. But it seems like they don't really have too much pressure to innovate-they already have lots of power and money and just need to keep the cogs running."
"662","The problem with soft skills is you don't get a precise feedback. 

Being liked by coworkers: Finished in 12ms  
Saying ""I like your butt"" has thrown an InappropriateException  
All convos at a party have passed unit tests"
"663","On the other hand, you fit right in this industry if you have autistic qualities. Many people have agreed on that."
"664","You don't need to be super social to get ahead.

Soft skills are more about being professional."
"665","100% agree with this, and I use it to highlight who I am on Linkedin. My whole bio is geared towards selling that not only do I have top-notch technical skills, but also amazing people skills.   


In an industry like ours where being good at socializing is a rarity, it can really give you an edge to get ahead. You'll find you get more opportunities (in a healthy organization) to do what you want, to attend special training or travel events, and people are more likely to want you on their team. All this inevitably gets you more experience and more ""buzz"" around you as an engineer. Around review time, you should see huge benefits.   


I have been lucky enough last year to have my team lead be so impressed with me that he wrote an email to my manager about my performance (highlighting how easy I am to work with as the first bullet!). My team lead doesn't even work at my company!   


I can't stress enough how important this stuff is."
"666","Yes, so much this.
I live in Germany so interviews might be different. But when I compare mine to my friends (who is a little more introverted and more anxious in social situations) I absolutely see a huge difference even though he is way better codingwise than I am.

This shows in:
Me being called back literally the day after applying mostly, while he waits weeks for responses.

Me being offered a job / apprenticeship / training etc. again almost immediately after the interview (with the exception of one I usually got along super well with the interviewees and we laughed and joked a lot)
vs him waiting days to weeks for responses only to be invited to another interview (up to 4)

We applied to similar / the same companies for the same job / training too.

It's crazy."
"667","If you're a Data Scientist/Data Analyst then to me, having the softer skills mean that you are just as skilled in; framing business problems, focusing on the end-user, communication of technical concepts, problem solving, and teamwork as you are in the latest tech and tools.

If you don't have those softer skills it can be difficult for you to turn the amazing tech work you do into some that can be understood and implemented by the business.  At the end of the day they're paying you to add value to the bottom line..."

"670","Omg why are you telling them!"
"671","You need to be competent in both technical skills and soft skills, seen candidates get rejected because they were weak in one of the two."
"672","Yep, getting along with others is a valuable skill in every arena of life. No idea why anyone would think software engineering is immune from this. Getting along with your team will increase job satisfaction, promotions, work quality (you'll collaborate with people more) etc. NOT getting along with your team will get you fired."
"673","I agree with you for the most part. A few which seemed odd or need clarification:

&gt; good standing/walking posture (shoulders back, seriously)

Most won't care if you aren't being super weird about it.

&gt;dress well

To an extent, but again, most people won't care within reason. I've worn jeans to interviews at big tech companies. No need to dress up in a suit or something. But don't walk in with an old tshirt and flip flops.

&gt;firm handshake,

I don't think anyone cares.

Just be a decent human being and try to be likable. If you're the best developer ever, but no one wants to work with you, you probably won't get hired, and if you do, you probably won't last long."
"674","by dress well, i don't mean suit up, i mean clean clothes that go with each other. also dressing in clothes that make you look good will make you more confident and perform better. same thing with point 1, the posture thing is not just for others, a good upright posture with your shoulders back will make yourself feel more confident."
"675","Yes 100% agree. I should have been more clearer, I was trying to provide clarification, not disagree with you. Too many people confuse ""dressing well"" with wearing a suit.

I've seen plenty of people interview at big tech companies wearing a suit, and they stick out. You'd be surprised at how many people don't realize that you can also overdress."
"676","You're just nitpicking man. You don't lose anything by doing any of the things you nitpicked, you only stand to gain."

Dress well don't mean suit vs not, it means wearing whatever style you have in a put together way. Matching sizing, materials, colours and so on. Not some random college print hoodie with ugly navy colour jeans and hiking shoes"
"678","I am realizing this is NOT the field for introverts that I was hoping it would be."
"679","Please stop misusing the word ""introvert.""

Being an introvert means that you ""recharge"" through alone time and solitary hobbies. No more and no less. It doesn't mean being socially inept or getting a pass on developing your professional communication and leadership skills."
"680","What in the world are you on about? People need to stop upvoting complete nonsense. You are certainly setting the bar high for a senior dev by making up some definition rather than doing 2 seconds of research. That may be one aspect of an SOME introverts but ""no more no less""?"
"681","I'm an introvert myself.

My description is the [defining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion#Introversion) trait of an introvert. There are other traits which often coincide with introversion (like being shy and quiet, for example) but they are NOT necessary to the definition. Extroverts can also be shy and quiet.

I understand well that social interaction can be draining for introverts. My point is that that doesn't mean introverts can use that as an excuse to not develop their soft skills in ANY industry - not just this one."
"682","""introverted"" != antisocial personality disorder"
"683","It's more introvert-friendly than most, but you can't work within a company without interacting with other members of said company"
"684","I used to think my lack of ability to communicate effectively was because I was an introvert. I still would consider myself an introvert, but I've learned how to function very well in social situations through exposure and learning how to process my emotions."
"685","I haven't been on a date in 20 years though"
"686","The importance of soft-skills is incredibly overblown.  First of all, no matter how many times you drill it into some people's heads, you can't change decades of low self-esteem and poor confidence by telling them to practice being sociable, not going to happen.  Secondly, the idea of practicing to be sociable is such an autistic thing to say.  I mean really.  This is not something you can grind like leetcode -- you either have it or you don't, and if you don't, well most people really don't care to be honest. You can go out to the club every day and try to meet new people, but that doesn't mean you'll become socially competent.  Social skills take literal years if not decades to develop and are often influenced by life experiences and upbringing.  

If you're socially awkward and have poor social skills, don't worry too much about it, but you do need to remember a couple things.  You do need to learn to speak up here and there, and you need to stand up for yourself.

I see too many comments on here where people don't like a co-worker, so they'll just make a Reddit thread or go straight to HR about something.  No one likes people like that.  If someone is making you upset or uncomfortable, say something -- politely of course."
"687","I was a basement dweller with a long distance girlfriend for about 7 years of my life, my youth, up to the age of 19. I did not have any friends, was in my room all day and read / played video games. I literally couldnt do anything, from calling doctors, talking to my PARENTS or interacting with anyone even in school.

So I said fuck it, I dont want to be like that. And for the next 2 years I talked to everyone, practiced not scaring people away, learned what's funny and how to apply jokes and how to make people laugh, learned how to walk and talk.

Now my girlfriend says I am the most social and outgoing person she knows, I get along well with everyone I meet, have a bunch of good friends and enjoy social interaction. Cant believe I'd ever say the last part.

You can definitely practice and learn social skills. I did it myself, and if I, a literal slug basement dweller nerd did it, so can everyone else. Even if they need a therapist, so be it, thats why they exist, to help. Dont be ashamed to need other people."
"688","It took you a few years though, which is what I was saying.  I'm not saying don't improve.  I'm saying, it's not like leetcode, where you can just keep practicing it in a couple months and then turn into a gigachad.  Behavior is something that takes years to develop, and I just think it's a lot of weight to put on new college grads who are reclusive and introverted on top of other stresses like practicing algorithms and coding.  

tldr; stay improving, but don't place too much stress on fixing your personality."
"689","Yeah I don't really care about my co-workers posture or if they're making eye contact or their handshake (never shook any of my co-workers hands so far). Someone else making too much eye contact makes me super uncomfortable. I'm ok as long as the other person isn't an asshole."
"690","this x100, jesus it's common sense. although i guess it's easier to say this when you've been on the other side of an interview and know how arbitrary the judgement can be."
"691","The world is full of charming people who can't actually do much. Then there are those are do the grinding and get stuff done and don't waste time on a\*\*e licking. Smart employers choose a mix of both according to their needs."

Be honest be real and be clear. Dont BS. If you work a place with all the politics and BS games to play I am sorry. It sucks. Some companies aren't like that and they value truth honesty. Brutal honesty like hey this timeline needs to be 3x longer or we wont make it"

I help evaluate soft skills for multiple job roles and have definitely rejected candidates who lacked these skills."

"704","Yes. The strongest rejections I have written have been for soft skills. And I can think of one candidate in particular that seemed great for the job but who I nixed due to arrogance/taking credit for other people's work. (Obviously only when another interviewer confirmed the same evaluation.)

I'm a PM. At past companies other teams explicitly asked for me in their loops/there were generally more multidisciplinary interviews. At my current company it started up out of the blue and just seems to be an odd set of circumstances that leads them to me. ¯\\\_(Ä)\_/¯"
"705","[deleted]"
"706","You'll never know whether a candidate has other offers. You also don't know how the candidate performed in other interviews.

When all the individual feedback is looked at on the whole it needs to show that the candidate has met the bar on each required dimension. I have never seen a candidate who absolutely bombed an entire dimension get through. Some version of ""soft skills"" (usually very specific skills you are asked to evaluate) is always a required dimension for every job role.

So yes, with that context, none of the candidates who've bombed soft skills have been extended an offer. But both bombing soft skills and nailing coding/system design/other technical skills is pretty rare. I've seen it a grand total of once (candidate was rejected, yes). If you bomb an area you're not qualified for the job, plain and simple."

I will reject an unlikeable candidate just because I don't want to work with them. My strong negative feedback will have a direct impact on them getting an offer. The health of the team is more important than individual technical skills."
"716","* Whenever a class required Minitab, SPSS, etc. I did the homework in R so I'd get good at it.

* I taught myself basic Python via a Codecademy tutorial but was by no means an expert when I graduated.  You're probably better off taking Intro to Programming in the computer science department.  If it's taught in Python, then great!  If it isn't, it'll probably be in a language that's harder to learn than Python and you can teach yourself Python quickly.

* I learned SQL through the book ""Learn SQL in Ten Minutes"", which is a bunch of ten-minute lessons on concepts in SQL.  The nice thing about SQL is that it's the most important skill you'll have, but you can learn 90% of it in a week.

* I learned SAS when classes required it.  I wouldn't put a ton of time learning it on your own, just because you will get really frustrated and the other skills have better documentation, better learning resources, and aren't exceedingly frustrating to use like SAS is."
"717","&gt; I learned SAS when classes required it. I wouldn't put a ton of time learning it on your own, just because you will get really frustrated and the other skills have better documentation, better learning resources, and aren't exceedingly frustrating to use like SAS is.

Coded in R for two years, my new job require SAS and you absolutely nailed how I would describe it. It's far more difficult to google answers and find resources in SAS. Also, the 'keep x' without the equal sign and 'keep=x' with it is confusing as hell."

Sas has good resources you just need to know where to look. The documentation itself has a bunch of examples. Lex jansen is also a good place to look.  Saying that, SAS is frustrating."
"720","Personal take: SAS has fine resources if you're the type of person who looks to documentation and technical support for solutions. It has *terrible* resources if you're the type of person who googles questions looking for a Stack Exchange post."
"721","[deleted]"
"722","Definite agree on the learning curve part. The learning curve on SAS is very steep, especially if you're like me and get thrown into a project using it without ever having used it before. There are tons of little things that don't behave as you'd expect coming from other languages where you can make mistakes. (I'm looking at you, `LAG` &gt;.&gt;) 

I haven't gotten to the point that I can say I'm more efficient at doing anything in SAS than alternative environments, though. Any efficiency in code is counteracted by my own inefficiency in changing my thinking to SAS's logic. I usually do a barebones extraction and then export as soon as feasible, so I'm by no means an expert."
"723","Yeah id agree. I use SAS at work and i still google stuff (as i learnt other languages girst) i just know now to jump straight to the sources i suggested"
"724","I absolutely agree. To add, it might be helpful to get ""credentials."" Try Coursera for beginner to advanced certificates on R, Python, SAS, and SQL offered by leading experts (both academic and industry). It likely won't be better than learning it yourself but at least you'll have something saying you have formal expertise. Good luck!"
"725","SAS isnt as common (I think its primarily for healthcare now), thus its not as crucial to learn if you dont plan on ending up there. Initially, I didnt agree with what people here said about SASit was, after all, the easiest little language for me to pick up in school. But then I realized that most people here have had to learn it on the job or because classes required it (and didnt focus on it), while I was able to take a class in it essentially from the ground up. There is a University Edition available for you to use as a student (I think your college doesnt have to register or anything like that), otherwise you likely wont get very far trying to learn SAS on your own because of the cost to use the license.

In any case, the documentation available for SAS is fine 95% of the time. Its pretty accessible and everything you need is out there in easy-to-understand formats."
"726","[deleted]"
"727","I agree with this wholeheartedly. I learned basic level languages at first in middle / high school but stuff really clicked when I took AP CS and learned core tenants of programming languages that are universal after that. Now when I interview data science folks I couldnt honestly care if they know Python v. R but whether they understand the fundamental programming concepts and statistical concepts they are seeking to implement."
"728","When you interview, do you care how they learned R or python? Do you have a preference for self-taught versus code boot camp or university taught? What if they know neither R or python but they have good foundations in java and C?"
"729","They don't care. But they do care what you have done with it. Courses,  home projects, research, work experience.  I would argue these in ascending order of importance."
"730","Agreed. Id add a caveat that Id expect some work experience ideally the more senior the position. 

Honestly i was also self taught for all my languages with the exception of Java so I dont care as long as youre able to explain basic concepts. I.e. if you claim that you know SQL be ready how different joins work, group bys, and Cartesian products."

"732","(1) get motivated to write code every day

(2) write a lot of code over many days of several years + read about coding (synergistic)

(3) show other people the product to get feedback

(4) formally study programming

(5) continue programming regularly and learning new languages as the job/class requires or facilitates

I taught myself to program in middle school (my calculator couldn't download games, so I wrote my own). I took a complete set of computer science courses as an undergraduate. I worked in computationally intensive research for several years after, eventually obtained an industry software engineering job, and now am almost complete a PhD in neuroscience (where I focused on electrophysiology, and yet still regularly used computer science skills and languages like SQL, C++, R, Matlab, Python...)

What I have learned over about 20 years is that it's kind like learning a foreign language -- you have to practice on a regular basis to become skilled.

The same principle applies to statistical programming languages."
"735","Thank you."
"736","I learned SAS and R on the job, but would not have gotten the job without having taken a class in C.  I would just take the basic programming classes available to you, in whatever language, then learn SAS/R or other language as needed."
"737","I learned SAS and R while taking statistical methods and applied series time classes. For R there are more options outside academia, there's a series of classes from John Hopkins in coursera. With SAS you might want to look if there are any applied classes that work with the software.


The languages you will be required to learn depend on the industry, say SAS is required if you want to go into pharmaceutical/health related industry. For general data science statistics R, Python, SQL are required. For BI/data analyst they usually go for Python,SQL and Tableau knowledge. Some places still work heavily with Excel.

Look what the industry you want to go in is looking for and learn those skills. And, since you are in 1st year, keep updated on what employers want, which might change by the time you graduate."
"738","I've learned many languages and frameworks over the past 45 years.   I say this all the time and I believe it firmly:   ""There is no substitute for sitting down and writing bad code"""
"739","Sounds too important to forget"
"740","I think /u/coffeecoffeecoffeee gave some really good advice and it's at the top for a reason, but I have a couple of points to add.

* Please, please, please focus on learning open source tools where available. The sooner we can ditch proprietary and non-free environments the better for everyone! Yes, this means ditching SAS. I learned numerical programming on Matlab and Mathematica, and spent a significant amount of personal time relearning things in R and Python that could've been spend better actually doing real work.
* Just to reiterate - I am advocating you ignore proprietary platforms (SAS, Matlab, etc) to benefit the broader numerical computing community. You may wish to learn some of them if required, but the trend of using them in many fields is diminishing quickly.
* The level of programming skills you learn in your coursework is likely to be minimal to moderate at best. Start to learn some git and post your personal and course code to github.
* Find packages that you like/use on github and browse their layouts to better learn how to structure your own code. Honestly, this is one of the biggest things that you most likely won't find in your coursework. It's super helpful for other people if you structure your code in a way that is similar to how most people do it in whatever language you choose.
* Use those intro CS classes to get an idea of things to implement in other languages.
* Look at all the languages at your disposal: As an aspiring statistician I'd look at R, Python, Javascript, Julia, and maybe learning a bit of C, C++, Java, or Fortran depending on if you think you might get into the heavier computational side of things. Choose 1 or 2 and try to really get a handle on them.
* Find something you're interested in implementing in whatever languages you really find yourself jiving with.
* Things like SQL (or at least language-specific interfaces to it), tabular data interfaces (dataframes in R, pandas in Python, etc), plotting libraries, etc will start to come more naturally once you've gotten a decent handle on the base languages you find yourself liking."
"741","&gt;Can I expect to learn more about programming in a statistics graduate program?

Yes for sure. As you learn the topic you will probably also learn the language as you solve problems.

That said. It never hurts to get an early start. Pick a language (R?) to start with and find tutorials online. Another way that worked for me is to try to recreate results of previous analyses using a new language, that gives you something that you already know how to do and all you need to do is 'translate'. 
As you move on in your career you will learn other languages much faster."
"742","I'm not a statistician - more of a data scientist or even data engineer - but my undergrad degree was in math. In my experience, almost every employer expects you to have SQL and may even give you explicit tests on it. Other tools are more variable; some employers will require them to get the job while others are willing to teach you.

I learned SQL from Stanford's online Introduction to Databases and highly recommend it. The material was well-presented, and I wouldn't have the job I have now without having taken that course."
"743","SQL is better for general employment and marketability. 

Learn SAS if you want to get your foot in the door for one of those specialize fields that uses SAS. Mostly because no one wants to spend the time or license fees to teach anyone SAS. It is a bit of a catch-22. 

That being said, SAS shops are often desperate for SAS programmers."
"744","SAS I learned through a job, but basically self taught (""here's the manuals"", he said, pointing to three full shelves of books, ""get to it"").  
SQL I learned in a programming class on databases (both that and SAS I learned in the 80s).  
R I taught myself in the late 90s/early 2000s.  

That's not even a fifth of the languages / packages I learned for statistics though. For a good while there I was learning about two a year."
"745","SAS you basically HAVE to learn on the job, because it is expensive and the free online one is not very good and not really at all comparable to what the actual software is like. I mean, you can pay to do sas base programmer, but then you also need to buy the software. I am in the process of learning SAS for my job, and they paid for training and when I have an issue i just google it. I also was recommended ""the little book of SAS"".In my (limited) experience, when employers have expensive, specialized software like SAS or SAP, they are willing to teach you on the job and usually have a training budget. When employers use a free, open source software like R, it is more likely that they will want you to have those skills or will want you to learn it without paying for training. 

SQL I am also in the process of learning via udemy course, and R i am in the process of learning via coursera. So for me the only real way to learn has been to have to do something and then google and try things until i find the solution. That being said, a certificate program or diploma from a college could be good too."
"746","I am a data analyst with a degree in Economics: SQL is a prime driver and the other are very great toppings on the cake. Have a solid SQL background, I used Udemy.com and took a course for a small fee ($20). They have you run through the examples as you go along. I Use R when needed (wish I had time to get stronger). Basically every company will use its own programs but if youre strong at a particular language and it brings value to the company, request to have it (Up to them depending on price). 
Once youre comfortable using SQL or R or any language.. create small fake subsets of data and practice with that. Practice makes perfect!!

"748","All online.

For SQL, I just googled how to create a database and worked on building my own data base, creating tables, and just trying to make sense of it all. I think this is one of the best projects to do to learn SQL.

"749","when somebody pay me to learn, speaking as someone who didn't take a single course in the languages you mentioned nor a course in stats &amp; prob but like you took math in undergrad (then went on to do a phd in algebra). btw, you should add python."
"750","I had done programming classes in java and c#, and wasn't introduced to R until I entered my degree (math). I already had a decent grasp of OOP and data structures, so it wasn't the hardest transition. But, when I got my first job I realized I was crap at R in the grand scheme of things and forced myself to solve work problems in R, even if it could be simply done in Excel or SQL. For me, the biggest help to learning it was to apply it to current work problems regardless of it necessity."
"751","In R/python, I tried to pick-up a new skill every week by forcing myself to do a work task by coding. I learned shiny, OCR, and many neat tricks in data viz just thru that.

Also, whenever i pick up a new stats concept, I always look up an R package and try to understand how it works."
"752","datacamp and only datacamp."
"753","I minored in CS."
"754","Learned R in my Stats courses, Matlab and STATA in a course but never used it, Python from Udemy, SQL from YouTube, Excel from idk."
"755","Several classes in SAS and R.  For resources, Little SAS Book, Applied Survival Analysis Using R, and Survival Analysis Using SAS were good books I used to reference code."
"756","Did a minor in computer science back in the day, got exposed to Pascal, C/C++, FORTRAN, LISP, Java (blech), Basic, some assembly language... Going to R from C is a breeze. SAS is a dinosaur and a pain, but with a bit of practice you get a hang of the basics. SQL can be a bit of a pain if you try to do funky operations, but the basics of data querying and manipulations don't take long to figure out, as long as your data is fairly simple. I keep meaning to do more Python but every time I get nasty surprises. Still, programming languages are like piano: practice, practice, practice, that's the best way to get better at it.

Still, some computer science theory on algorithm and some math do help in figuring things out regardless of the programming language paradigm."
"757","There is no idiot in cs field, all you have to do is find ur passion and google will be your best teacher."
"758","I first learned BASIC, m68k assembly, Pascal, C, Python and some lesser known languages. Then R became very simple."
"759","I learned SQL on the job, actually. Start querying a single table. Then do inner joins with 2. Then outer. Just a bit at a time, really. Theres stuff online that can help, but nothing beats picking at a database, IMO."
"760","As a student, you can get access to a lot of the SAS training courses for free if you decide that it's something that you want to focus on in your own time:  [https://www.sas.com/en\_us/learn/academic-programs/resources/free-sas-e-learning.html](https://www.sas.com/en_us/learn/academic-programs/resources/free-sas-e-learning.html) . There's free learning software that you can use to help practice the exercises in the training courses."
"761","jumped in and worked with it. The only way to learn a (computer) language is use it and use it often."
"762","You can use the websites Strata Scratch and DataCamp. Strata Scratch is helpful for SQL and Python and DataCamp for SQL and R."
"763","For me the only real gap was getting to grips with the huge existing codebase, and how it all fit together

I don't sit around applying Djikstra's algorithm all day, but knowing how the underlying theory is working did definitely help me get on board with the work much faster

Also, in my degree we really focused on Java, and I've never used it in my job. However that deep dive has made it WAY easier to get into other languages since you can very much see parallels between them"
"764","Working with big code bases is the one thing I really wish I had learned in school.  My SWE classes exposed us to things like architecture, testing, code smells, devops, all that extra stuff we do that isn't directly writing application logic.  But when every assignment is doable in under 500 lines between 3 files it just doesn't click.  It took about 6 months of FTE for me to finally grasp why that's important."
"765","This is funny because in the last year Ive found Djikstras was a great solution to our problems on 3 different occasions. Formulating problems as graphs is great if you can manage it."
"766","Yeah dont think this will ever come into play making boring ass CRUD apps"
"767","What kind of problems are you working on?"
"768","I work on a moonshot product at a major tech company doing long term market analysis etc. Basically defining what this moonshot product might look like and building simulation software to estimate market demand and model the impact of marginal business decisions on long term viability."
"769","Thats sick. I am jealous haha. Robinhood...?"
"770","I really do enjoy what I do. My main concern is I have no idea how to find another job similar to it that would both be as satisfying and also leverage my skills. Im somewhat in the market for career progression reasons but these roles are hard to find for sure.

And nope, not Robinhood."
"771","I also work at a major tech company I get paid a ton to do it but some days it feels like hell on earth. It can be very boring. How did you find this job?"
"772","Started in the company on a much more boring team and networked my way there. I was in the market for a role change and my old manager was supportive of that. Met with about 10-15 internal managers about what their teams were doing, someone eventually introduced me to who would become my manager on the moonshot team. 

I made it pretty clear I was interested in the product/challenge. They were looking for experimental idea-oriented people who are more interested in being flexible and fast than perfect and planned, which was right up my alley."
"773","This is a great post on the importance of non tech skills"
"774","I agree, I harp a lot on this sub on the importance on networking in job search/satisfaction, but most people just like to hear leetcode über alles because that feels less subjective and easier to grind in isolation.

Not trying to beat that horse right now though."
"775","As you progress up the ranks to senior Dev or architect the algorithmic stiff will become more useful
Stick in there mate!"
"776","The thing you don't get prepared to are

* using Git in the real world

*  PR and code reviews 

* Server issues and configuration

* continuous integration 

* having multiple environments

* using redmine or jira and managing your tickets

*  communication with clients or users

* trying to anticipate side effects

* the stress of putting something in production that have a high impact on users

* the complexity of databases and codebases in businesses, especially when they're quite old, the technical dept is high and legacy code is hard to deal with

Your brand new app that you've made alone in 2 months with a 10 tables database, pushing on master, without project management and hosted on your machine is not training you for that"
"777","I'm probably stubborn but I joined a company recently that uses JIRAs and we have to write technical design docs for everything we do, daily standups(scrums) I honestly find it annoying but that's my opinion I guess. I'm not a super pro developer or anything. And yeah PRs... many ways to do something but then your implementation gets murdered/reworked before gets merged ah... and the testing man with Jasmine/Mocha and Selenium ahhhhhh I used to just be a coder back then now it's like more ""logistics"" than coding and progress is slow story's have time allotments of 160hrs+ usually like crazy. But I see it you know... some old code, so many people work on it, those old tests have to pass and your new ones too."
"778","You can definitely have too much process. But not enough, and your cowboy coding ain't gonna fly in a real world project."
"779","Yeah not in this case(corporation), maybe a sole project(that's my ultimate goal really, self-owned saas products) not denying need for security/good design but yeah. I'm also seeing the depth of knowledge I still go by ""full stack"" but my day job is one sided eg. mainly frontend framework, the backend is completely abstracted away which kind of sucks(to me as I like that side more) but yeah... trying to do your own projects from 0 I'm realizing like ""it's a piece of crap"" especially when you're not a designer(me).

"781","CI and CD is automated builds and tests, when you merge something on the master, you run a tool that does every step necessary to deploy. For a website it might be doing installing vendors, installing assets, clearing caches, etc. Everything that you'd do by hand to update your application is done automatically

CI is more about automated tests and CD about releasing updates

At work we have tests, security checks and linters running when we commit to a branch and the build will fail if something doesn't pass. Then once your branch is good, you push it to the branch, launch a build on Jenkins,which fetches the source, builds everything, creates a new directory on the server and finally creates a symbolic link on the latest release (we keep 5 releases) 

TBH I'm not good at it and other people in the team are managing it, but you still have to understand how it works."
"782","Continuous integration really just means that various tests are run regularly. Continuous deployment is the same thing for releases. Often there'll be automatic deployment to a test environment and then people will pick good releases to go to prod.

CI helps catch bugs fast. Often you'd automatically run tests for every change or PR or the likes, which can catch bugs before they're even merged in (and thus impacting others). However, CI only works if you have good tests.

Docker and Kubernetes are unrelated. Docker is a container system for making deployment and building easier. Particularly, it helps avoid the ""it works on my machine"" issue by abstracting away from your OS and hardware (but being lighter weight than a VM). K8s is a way to deploy containers, especially to make it easy to scale them and have them interact with each other."
"783","You may not be using all that theory in your day to day, but being informed as to how things work in the underlying system and understanding why things are designed in certain ways is invaluable.

For some more directly transferrable skills, try learning how to work in a team environment (possibly using agile or some other methodology), try to touch a wide range of topics and tools, and most importantly learn how to learn effectively. A company hiring a new grad isn't going to expect them to be immediately useful, but being able to pick things up quickly will be a god-send."
"784","&gt;	but being able to pick up things will be a god-send

This right here is the truth, if you can show the higher level engineers you are willing you put in the work to learn different things that may be uncomfortable at first is when it'll push you towards the ranks of those."
"785","100% the truth. I started a month ago and once I started asking questions that required a higher level of understanding my tech lead seemed a lot more relaxed about having me on the team. School just teaches you how to learn, then you must take those skills into the real world. The amount of business logic at an enterprise level is ridiculous."
"786","[deleted]"
"787","found the guy who creates 1 month old legacy code."
"788","Fuck you.  :("
"789","Oh yes daddy stuff my tight little view"
"790","What does the term ""business logic"" mean? I see that phrase a lot, but have no idea what it means."
"791","it means business specific parts of the code. for example say your company needs to transfer a file from a remote server N number of times a day and each transfer needs to have a time stamp attached along with a uuid or something to that affect. how you implement this/architect it is entirely up to you, however the business logic of what needs to happen has already been determined. hope that helps."
"792","let's say you are Screenflix, a hypothetical streaming subscription company. What is the core purpose of Screenflix as a business? To deliver content to customers and keep them glued to the screens. 

Business logic: CDN, Edge caching, data-mining and ML in addition to the regular signup, sign on, watch flows. 

Not business logic: reinventing the telco-scale networking devices (unless proven to be a bottleneck)


So business logic is the part of software/engineering that fills the gaps between existing solutions brought to market."
"793","Business logic is / are the constraints and processes that a business uses to accomplish its goals.

To contrast business logic against system logic I would make this distinction: you typically cannot Google business logic. You will Google the mechanics or implementation details of it, but you can almost never Google business logic, because that is all about stakeholders."
"794","can you give an example of a new thing to learn? like a new programming language?"
"795","Everything is a new thing to learn:

* New languages
* New codebases (where things are, how they interact, why they're designed that way)
* New tools (build systems, bug systems, telemetry, logs analysis, debuggers, on and on)
* Accessibility (and how it works with every new toolchain you interact with)
* Localization (and how it works with every new toolchain you interact with)
* World Readiness
* Estimating the cost of work
* Who the essential people to know/interact with are (subject matter experts, people who are reliable)
* How to interact with other teams productively
* Who your users are
* What your users currently use your product for and want to use your product for
* Who your competition is and what they're doing

And on and on and on.  Every day you will be learning new things."
"796","This is a great point. Every single job I've had involved learning something new, whether it's a new language, a new source control system, new libraries, new testing frameworks, even new operating systems. There are things that people now take for granted (cloud stuff - AWS, GCP, and container infrastructure like docker/kubernetes) that I actually struggled to learn after having 20 years of software dev experience. I only recently started truly understanding git.

Learning some of that stuff actually got in the way of me being able to do my job. I'd ask another dev for help and they'd tell me what to do and it sounded like gibbrish. I said ""alright, just tell me what commands to type"". So I'd spend my evenings studying up on all of the various technologies that I didn't understand, which is humbling for someone with multiple decades of experience in a staff-level role. On the other hand, I know my limits and have no problems asking a junior dev for help if they've been at the company longer than me."
"797","Any tips for learning new codebases? I feel like I barely make any progress staring at some massive git repo and trying to piece it together."
"798","Step 1: Check documentation and see if someone else has already written down a guide.  If so, read that.

Break it down into smaller pieces and start somewhere (exactly where doesn't really matter).  This can be significantly helped by a good code search tool or IDE that can index the codebase and take you to the definition of symbols.

If the codebase is structured well, this shouldn't be crazy - start looking at a file (tracing interesting functions or codepaths outside the file as necessary), then a directory, and so on.  You don't need to look at every file or know every bit of functionality, but having a map of the major components is very useful.

....and then go write it down so the next person doesn't have to duplicate your work."
"799","If it's an open source project, just pick an issue and try to fix it.

That way, you're going in with a specific goal as well as some keywords you can use to locate the problem area. If you *do* end up figuring it out then you can create a PR and give back to the community, which also helps build soft skills that are very analogous to ones you'd use in a professional environment.  

Even if the issue is too complex to make progress on, it at least gives you a reason and some guidance to tinker with a large codebase. Hell, just figuring out how to build such a project locally can be a feat on its own, and you'll learn a lot while doing it."
"800","Clone the whole repo, get it in your IDE and compile it yourself.  Once you get that working, start at the entry point, go line by line, and click through to definitions to see how everything is working.  Use actual business logic software, not just a library (unless you just want to see how certain functions are implemented).

You could run the software and find something arbitrary to change, even just text strings or prompts, or expand and add your own commands."
"801","Ive seen seniors introduce patterns that Junior devs won't implement because they're not used to it and don't know it well. They would rather do something they're comfortable with to get the job done quicker rather than learn something new. 

For example, a senior will use the strategy pattern where as a junior dev would rather use a nested if else statement on a type check instead of taking the up front time to learn and understand the design pattern. This makes all the difference in maintainable scalable code.

Whether someone is actually capable of learning new things and trusting that they'll take the time to do something right is besides the point. An education is hard evidence that they're more willing to learn and not cut corners. It makes employers more confident in long term investments."
"802","My experience has been the opposite. Senior developers reluctant to use new patterns. At Big N."
"803","Cool"
"804","Yeah, I think it's pretty generalizable. You need a strategy to get people to adopt new ideas."
"805","&gt; but being able to pick up things will be a god-send

This right here. Got hired as a full Stack dev, without having any experience with modern (or any) web frameworks, like angular, or any experience in Web development in general (always did application or embedded stuff). But just because I knew the fundamentals, I'm able to complete my tasks without too much of a hitch."
"806","I'm literally going through this and this will help me push further."
"807","Gonna hint that in my next job interview"
"808","Theres a guy on our team who teaches university level discrete math. He lives and dies by theory/underlying principles"
"809","I loved discrete math as a student, now I want to retake it as an engineer and see if I can better understand application."
"810","Agreed. I was worried when I got out of college, since then I found most companies I've worked with weren't too much worried on how much theory I knew.

The biggest thing I have learned from dev field is you need to be able to communicate and work as a team. There have been guys hired who were more qualified than me, but they could not communicate and just read the room when explaining their solutions for a problem with the team. There have been so many times where two people were ""arguing"" about how to solve a problem, when they were actually saying the exact same thing and I would have to step in and get them to realize they were on the same page.

Or we have had coders where they think they know everything and will just keep quiet and code away, when they didn't bring it to the team to see if it made sense. So after they have spent two days coding and we reviewed the code, they were super defensive and upset.

Keep the mentality of your code you write is going to suck in the beginning, don't take it personally when someone reviews your code and tells you where you went wrong. You are part of a development team, just learn from it and keep coding away. There have been guys who have code way longer than I've been alive and I still find problems in their code from time to time."
"811","&gt; try learning how to work in a team environment (possibly using agile or some other methodology)

Agree to learning to work in a team environment. Disagree that anyone should spend time on ""Agile"". It's all buzzwords, and every company has their own variations in terms of how they do it. Moreover, no employer is going to look at a new grad telling them ""I've used agile before"" and hear that as a benefit, as it's unlikely that whatever context they have ""used"" it in will mirror a professional environment.

To anyone interested in Agile, I strongly recommend you want the first 7 minutes of this video: [One Hacker Way by Erik Meijer](https://vimeo.com/110554082)"
"812","I agree working on a team environment is essential and not taught in school, but theres no way a bunch of students are going to effectively use agile for anything really."
"813","I've been a software engineer for 10 years. I started in the C++ world writing windows applications and now I'm in the web world building websites and writing APIs. Here's a few things I can say:

* I have never, once, had to write a sorting algorithm.
* I have never had to balance a binary tree.
* BigO is cool to know, and talk about, but it's not as prevalent as school makes it seem (outside of interviews).

Almost every CS/SE job boils down to one thing: How do you get data from point A to point B."
"814","It's a shame how true this is yet every company wants to grill pretending like they do it, which they probably don't. The craziest thing to me is even if a sorting algorithm is written, it will be written once and copied many more times, whether internally or on SO/Wikipedia. 

I think bigO is important just to know that you can't write 4 loops within loops unless you absolutely must, and look for chances to write recursive functions."
"815","&gt;  look for chances to write recursive functions 

You would generally want to avoid recursive functions whenever possible. Recursive functions are by and large very inefficient. Most of the hard problems on leetcode can't even be solved with recursion because you would hit a time/memory limit."
"816","&gt; You would generally want to avoid recursive functions whenever possible. Recursive functions are by and large very inefficient.

This is a massive over-generalization."
"817","Of course, there are some optimization tricks like tail-end recursion, but it completely defeats the point of using recursion in the first place because it basically mimics iteration. Just because recursive solutions are simpler doesn't necessarily mean they're efficient when run by the computer. You don't use recursion for the sake of recursion. You use it when you have no other choice."
"818","Oh interesting, I thought many of them are nlogn and better than n^2 that people normally would do."
"819","You can get away with suboptimal solutions in most of the easy to medium leetcode problems, but not for the hard ones, and hence why simple recursive solutions won't work."
"820","Aren't there some languages built around being recursive. It might be more fair to have this caution for recursion in an OO language"
"821","Big O is very relevant for me and I use it most days.  I find it most useful when I can switch out a DS and get massive runtime gains (order n to constant time)"
"822","I dont think I stated that point as clearly as I could have. BigO is important in the sense that you need to know not to nest a whole bunch of loops.

However, the way colleges teach it, you'd think your boss would be coming up to you during every code review and asking you to figure out the notation for every algorithm.

BigO is more a way of teaching students rules which they should know by feel later on. For example, I can look at some code and know it's inefficient without calculating the bigO and comparing it to my new code."
"823","Exactly. No one is coming by my desk to ask for the runtime analysis, but it's still important to know."
"824","I imagine things like run time and latency are important in finance or embedded programming, no? 

Disclaimer: I am a student who is curious about this because those are fields I'm interested in. So I'm not trying to be snarky or anything."
"825","[deleted]"
"826","Thank you for the resource. It explained the issue very clearly."
"827","No one is asking for the big O of every algorithm you write. But if you write inefficient algorithms, you can expect the reviewers to point it out with a mention of big O. And most certainly you're expected to be able to calculate it in your head so that you don't write such algorithms in the first place.

It's actually one of the more relevant optimizations because scalability can be so important for many applications these days."
"828","Its in the name. Computer *science*. Engineering is different. CS isnt supposed to teach you real world stuff, its to teach you the theory. If you want a job youll need to learn real world stuff yourself. 

If only they explained this to every single person applying for CS instead of going on about how it gets you the job as long as you know your DS&amp;A. No. Skills gets you the jobs. And that requires much more than just going through a CS degree."
"829","I like this response the best. There are hundreds of thousands of Jr Devs with no degree. The skills required for a job have only some overlap with a CS degree."
"830","This is why I'm switching my major from CS to software engineering. The engineering department focuses on real-world skills and actively practices team development, code reviews, etc. My CS department is too much of ""do this and do that and done"", kinda like RPG missions."
"831","[deleted]"
"832","Im a Product Manager and I always appreciate new hires who come from an SE background over a CS one. They are MUCH more useful in the workplace and generally ramp up quicker. Their dev manager and I dont have to spend as much time coaching or correcting SEs.

Im glad you mentioned business writing - that, interpersonal communication, and basic SE skills like proper source control usage, code commenting, usage existing libraries &amp; design patterns, and being adaptable around legacy code are all things that make a huge difference."
"833","SE is not a degree offered at many good cs schools...so I dont see why you prefer SEs. The best coders in the world all mostly have CS degrees and math/physics/other engineering degrees of anything else."
"834","Most businesses don't need a supergenius pro hacker from MIT. Most businesses just need someone to build them products that their customers will pay them money for. That requires some basic level of technical skill, but after that basic threshold is met there's significant diminishing returns for increased technical skill compared to increased ability to do operations work and to communicate with other business units and so on."
"835","If that's your thinking then you're losing out on potential talent on CS peeps"
"836","what is the difference between SWE and CS in terms of course work really?"
"837","Agreed I would love to see a curriculum so I could address any gaps"
"838","Here's a term by term breakdown of University of Waterloo's Software Engineering program: http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/ENG-Software-Engineering

And here's their degree requirements for Computer Science: http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/MATH-Bachelor-of-Computer-Science-1

There's also even more theory focused versions of the CS degree, like the BMath in CS, but these two I listed are the big ones there. You'll note that software engineering at UW has lot more hardware and engineering fundamentals focus, while CS has a lot more math, and freedom in choice of specialization.

Edit: missing word"
"839","I thought i was familiar with the requirements of CS but that looks very different than what my degree requires interesting. I wonder how much can be chalked up to difference between the US and the EU. Thank you for sharing these resources."
"840","What do the requirements look like in your experience?"
"841","I think I over-exaggerated the differences on the first look because I didn't see a lot of those classes were a ""pick one of two""  type situation. I would say the biggest difference is I have to take 3 different algorithm classes."
"842","I am a senior at a pretty highly ranked CS school in the US, and while I am graduating as a Statistics/Applied Math major, I didn't decide until recently so I was taking the CS and Math curriculum at the same time. We had an introductory DSA class, a computational probability class, a discrete math class, and an advanced algorithms class as core requirements with an upper level requirement to take either Formal Language Theory or Combinatorics + Graph Theory. My buddies at other schools in the US doing CS degrees all have very similar requirements.

Then we have electives, where you can either take practical stuff like Web Programming or Computer Architecture or theory like Numerical Computing or our AI class (which is all theory).

The example above was from Waterloo, which is in Canada, so maybe they have a slightly different curriculum.

So the US CS curriculum might be more similar to yours than you realize."
"843","Waterloo is in Canada, so it's not quite the same as a US computer science curriculum."
"844","I did my undergrad in Computer Science and Engineering in 2010 from a south Asian university then completed my master's in CS from a Canadian University. What I personally feel from my experience that followings are the mandatory courses in CS and SWE apart from hardware courses:Programming Courses, Discrete Mathematics, Data Structure, Algorithms, Automata, Compiler, OS, Database, SW Basics with Design Patterns, Computer Architecture and basics of assembly language, Basics of AI, Basics of Networking."
"845","Not to sound cynical, but pretty much everything. 

Computer science is a science, its theoretical by nature. Software development is very hands-on and practical. Id say that design patterns and some algorithms and data structures is useful though  

Big differences are:
- source control (such as git)
- writing tests and leveraging test frameworks
- designing code into maintainable modules
- depending on the language and application type youll almost certainly be using a framework and API youre not familiar with
- databases, being able to use a database through code. Being proficient enough with SQL to work on existing systems, and troubleshoot any issues with production. 
- delivery models such as agile. 

I find that theoretically CS gives you a foundation in computing and how you might design a system, but real world experience builds upon that very quickly once you enter the workforce."
"846","My CS degree program had courses that touched on all these a little. The main issue in my current job is that our codebase was (and is) written and maintained by a series of amateurs who were (at times) over their heads. No testing, version control, modular design, formal development stages, etc. I'm trying to show them the light while being a good junior dev and not step on toes; thankfully they recognize their lack of formal knowledge and defer to me on those points."
"847","you have to use two \ns to separate lines even in a list"
"848","Yea virtually everything lmao. It's true"
"849","Having a strong foundation in the theoretical will help you in the long run, it can elevate your potential to become not just a software engineer, but a good software engineer. Armed with knowledge, you just need to gain experience in order to reach that potential. 

There's a difference between a code monkey and a developer.

I would always encourage people to complete their education, before heading to the workforce. (Unless you have special circumstances preventing you from doing so, eg. Finances, life event, etc.)

Edit: I entered the workforce as a junior web developer 9 years ago, and now I am in a leadership position supporting over 50 web developers."
"850","Is it because of efficiency of code?"
"851","Efficiency, code design, system architecture, understanding the underlying technologies, learning how stuff works.

It does mean during your education, you really spread out and learn as much as you can.

For example, I took courses on database systems, networking, compiler design. I ended up becoming a web developer. These topics on the surface, don't look like they have too much in common with HTML, CSS, JavaScript... right?  But in reality web sites and web apps require databases and internet to become useful because we have to deploy them somewhere. Understanding these neighboring concepts helps give us a more holistic view of the system... how everything works together; it leads to better, more resilient, application in the end and you're better equipped to support the application when it runs into issues. 

For example, when the webapp seemingly randomly experiences connection issues... your team is stumped because they don't see anything in the code that could cause it. So you  dig through the server logs and see this ""database error"". You then look at the backend code to trace down to the line where it tries to interact with the DB. You don't see anything weird there either. You trace more logs and realize that it happens to different services randomly, so it's not always the same backend service experiencing problems. You end up eventually pulling up all the different classes that are accessing the DB and realize some of them are actually trying to modify the same tables and the actual culprit was a database lock. 

If you hadn't taken any courses on databases, you may not have recognized the symptoms as database lock, and provide solutions on how to fix it.

And even though I mentioned compilers design course, that's just usually one of the hardest CS courses offered. The professor defines an imaginary programming language and asks the students to write an actual compiler for it. To pass the course he runs different snippets of code into your compiler to see if it's works. If you can survive that course, you'll probably have a strong grasp of understanding how programming languages and syntax are processed by the compiler and what's actually happening under-the-hood, and with enough coding chops to implement a compiler itself.

The main point is, finish school, really challenge yourself, push those limits on learning as much as you can, and on many different aspects. Having a good breadth of knowledge as well as depth in the topics that are important for the career path that you have in mind. That way, you enter the workforce better equipped to take on any challenge they throw at you, at that point, it's simply focusing on getting experience. Same concept applies at work too, challenge yourself, go above and beyond, help others out when you see them struggling. Skies the limit."

...and hit the ground running once starting?

- Get actually _good_ with `git`. Know how and when to use `rebase`, `reset`, `reflog`, `bisect`, `merge-base`.
- Knowing how to use the basics of Vim so you're not lost when you _have_ to use it
- How to interact with remote servers (`ssh`, `rsync`, and various cloud APIs and UIs)

"854","&gt; Get actually good with git. Know how and when to use `rebase`, `reflog`, `bisect`, `merge-base`.

I know how to use `rebase` and I know what `reflog` is, but after looking up the commands `bisect` and `merge-base` seem pretty niche."
"855","I'm also on the same boat. Except I can vouch for `bisect`. It is a really powerful tool to have when you're chasing a bug that you know was not there before. It saves time, but more importantly mental workload and gives you peace of mind that no matter how weird the bug is, if you're sure it was not there before, you're gonna find it."
"856","Merge-base is definitely quite niche, bisect will be used more often when dedugging to find which commit the bug was introduced."

"882","&gt; I'm dubious that any of this is practical in the real world

No no, it definitely is very useful in real world programming jobs. It's pretty much required if you want a good job and good colleagues.

But you are right, Computer Science is theoretical, that's the whole point of it. It's not supposed to teach you how a job works, it's supposed to teach you how computers work.

You can contrast this with another subject called Software Engineering which is about how to develop, build, deliver, and manage a software project in practice.

Try to learn a bit of both Computer Science and Software Engineering. But as for actual job knowledge, well you will need actual job experience to get that.

But that is true for any field, accounting, marketing, business, etc. Pretty much everyone who finishes school and goes into the job market will feel like a noob all over again."
"883","&gt;  It's pretty much required if you want a good job and good colleagues.

Yeah, thats not the slightest bit true. Anecdotal, but theres evidence of the contrary scattered all throughout my career. Two of the best developers Ive ever known had totally unrelated degrees, and one was a truck driver previously while the other was a school teacher previously."
"884","I agree with OP that the knowledge is required, but that doesn't mean you need a CS degree to get that knowledge. Like you I've worked with a brilliant software engineer who has good fundamental CS knowledge and never went to college."
"885","[deleted]"
"886","So then what makes a good candidate? If you think the degree doesn't allow us to learn on the job more quickly and be effective in the field then why even look for it?"
"887","&gt;	It's not supposed to teach you how a job works, it's supposed to teach you how computers work

Not disagreeing, your whole comment hit the nail on the head. Just wanted to clarify that the topic of CS is computation, not computers. They can be the same, but computers are not limited to electrical components - it is philosophy (formal logic) and math.

Not saying you are wrong, but that difference causes a lot of confusion in the world. Most people with computer jobs never look at the computer - hence why normal people dont understand what we do."
"888","The biggest gaps I noticed when I got out of school and into the workforce were these

- knowledge and experience with version control, beyond basic functionality

- my SQL proficiency

- the intuition on when to ask for help. don't spin your wheels too long on a single thing, but also don't ask for help right off the bat.

- my ability to communicate technical concepts to people who do not have the same technical background.

Edit: also managing dependencies on large scale applications and learning how to use dependency graphs to make sense of dependency hell."
"889","It's easy to look into the theoretical side and think that it'll all be useless but I think part of the goal for many people in CS is to eventually be in a job where it's not useless and very applicable. Those jobs do exist, although rarely, and you won't be able to do them if you aren't familiar with stuff like big-O and algorithm design. That's why companies screen for those tasks so heavily; if you do happen to pick up a task like that they can't have you just bodge it cause you've never heard of those skills. 

On the flip side the skill that I wasn't taught formally in my degree that has become by far the most useful is project planning. By that I mean the ability to take a full feature request and break it into the steps of gathering requirements, planning an architecture, breaking that into tasks, and implementing it. 

This is much more easily learned in internships. I had 2 that specifically just gave me a feature to work through those steps on for the entire internship, and that's the kind of internship experience you should expect at any of the places everybody wants to work.

Being able to architect entire features is what employers will look for to give promotions and is the best way to impress as a junior dev. If you're already past the point of getting out of school and hired you can start improving that now by doing things like participating in planning meetings or in architecture notes online at work."
"890","Junior dev here, 2 months salaried bootcamp, 6 months of professional work. I'd say everything, I learn far more practical skills in the past 8 months than in 5 years of college (excluding skills I taught myself).

My CS education was 80% theoretical, 20% practical and even those practical education was mostly useless because they were mostly either outdated technologies or bad practice.

I mean back in college web development as taught to us was all about writing .php files with notepad++ and copying it into XAMPP folder, along with using mysql managed by phpmyadmin. Back end codes, html, javascript, all mixed together. No REST, no N-Tier architecture, no unit testing or even breakpoint debugging. Why? Because we don't know better as we were taught by out of touch people who knows fuck all about how it's actually done in the industry.

The only useful skill I remember learning was about projects documents (BRD, etc.) and SQL, because SQL is timeless. But they were nothing that Indian youtubers in a 480p youtube videos can't teach better."
"891","This is the tech equivalent of ""Why do schools teach calculus instead of *real world* skills like how to do your taxes?"".

"892","Landed an apprenticeship last year that led to a full time junior position starting in Jan for 70k starting. 

If I had only what my classes taught me, I wouldn't have even been considered. Nearly all of what I learned to get that job was information that I taught myself outside of class doing various projects or courses. I have a friend who was sadly unable to get a job after college (though he's young and has time) that did nothing outside of coursework and is very upset about the situation and is very under-qualified last I spoke to him, saying that he wouldn't have had a clue of what to do when I explained to him what kind of project I had to do and turn into my workplace as part of the selection process.

Don't short yourself in the foot and waste a lot of money by *only* doing classwork. A lot of recruiters in my area would not consider graduates with nothing on their resume but a degree. 


Personally my system was really bad at teaching contemporary frameworks for the languages they taught and only covered either basic or old ways of doing things. If I were to give advise it would be to one start a project in something that interests you and two focus on learning the most popular frameworks for your favorite language"

"895","Many things. I was unemployed for 4 months, but 3 months ago I landed a role as a junior full-stack developer. I think the problem is more that technology changes so fast that it can be difficult to develop curricula that meets the needs of the software industry.

As a front-end/fullstack developer, the main things I missed were the following - **JavaScript** (it's everywhere in software, I graduated without writing any vanilla, plain JavaScript), **distributed systems** and **database architecture**, and cloud computing (**AWS** and **Google Cloud/Firestore**). I use these technologies on a daily basis. Thank God I knew React and iOS/Android by the time I graduated because I now have a better sense of frontend principles. I then learned more front-endy things on the job like Sass and wireframing.

Here's a project oriented indicator of your skillset - you should be able to build a performant system that solves a real world business problem. Make something you're interested in. 

For example, make a gradebook application for teachers. Write the frontend in JavaScript, and the API in Firestore or AWS. Create a login system that takes a username and password and logs a user into a restricted area only logged in users can see. Then create a frontend application that allows people to type in grades. Log changes to the gradebook in a message queue which then batch writes to the database. Then, have the database write to another frontend application targeted for administrators, parents and students that displays individual student calculated grades. There's a ton of data movement in this for a relatively straightforward system of managing student grades."
"896","What do you use firestore for?"

"914","While you won't use everything, I actually felt pretty prepared for my first job. Besides just picking up some new languages/technologies and the company-specific knowledge, which you have to do pretty much anywhere, the biggest gap for me was writing production quality code.

You're working on projects, usually largely from scratch, at most in a small group, and usually over a relatively short period (eg a couple months) and then throwing it all away. Colleges rarely test for (or are able to test for) things like maintainability and scalability. There was definitely an adjustment going from ""let me write some hacky shit that works"" and ""I have to write a maintainable, scalable solution"".

As for things from college that were super useful in the workplace, I felt that databases and distributed systems and/or parallel computing were super, super useful.

The same thing happens when you learn business from a book vs the real world.

In the real world, most everyone tries to screw you over, most everyone doesn't give a damn about your life and most everyone thinks they know everything about whatever they are talking about.  Most people will put in just enough effort to get a reward and nothing more.

This is usually reflected by how they treat their health, they put just enough work into their health to stay alive and nothing more.

If you really, really want real world skills, build a real world product that DOESN'T come from a tutorial.  Many ""programmers"" will search for a ready made solutions that they can download and compile and claim they built it.

"929","\&gt;   it all seems very theoretical and I'm dubious that any of this is practical in the real world.   


Actually, If you want to succeed in Computer Science, you need to learn the theory.  


TL;DR of it is that theoretical knowledge becomes useful when you are asked to develop whole modules and subsystems, and paves the way for your technical growth.. possibly till Architect. By that point your experience will weigh more in your decisions and designs.  


When you start your career, you will have a lot of questions amounting to ""why are they doing it this way? why can't they accept this simpler solution?"", or maybe ""I wish I knew an elegant way to implement this solution which doesn't require tons of ""if"" checks to cover the many edge cases"". Theory allows you to identify what tools and techniques apply to a problem:  


1. Theory helps you understand the problem: Is there a preexisting solution that's optimal? Is there an okay solution that takes a lot of CPU time? Are there only few good approximations that might yield bad results from time to time and with certain inputs? Or even more fundamentally, is it a problem that needs to be tackled  at all? (Does this problem a special case of a more general problem.. only worded differently? Does this problem even possible to solve?)
2. Based on what problem you are facing, Theoretical foundations help you decide what to do. You can save a lot of time that would have otherwise been wasted trying solutions that don't work... Or worse! that work most of the time but fail when deployed to production environment due to certain inputs.
3. Theoretical knowledge helps you communicate problems and technical details in a more clear, concise fashion, since you understand the big picture."

How do the unit and integration tests work?  What are the networking components?  What are the persistence components?  What are the messaging components?  How are builds done and artifacts captured?  What are the specs/use cases?  For the most part, you can break down any project into different discrete questions, and as long as the software/system is well built, you can dive into any specific area and get started pretty easily.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd say the most important technical skill in the workplace is to be able to figure out how something works (ie without any documentation, or with just straight up incorrect documentation); a big difference between a ""10xer"" and a mediocre engineer is that when the latter will throw his/her hands up when something doesn't make sense, the former will keep asking and answering questions until he/she figures out the root cause -- usually by going below the application and figuring out how to log/debug an application's dependencies (said at 11:20pm on a Tuesday:  ""Oh! The http library tries to send a TLS1.3 request even though it only supports up to TLSv1.2.  It silently fails during the handshake.  How dumb; I should let the maintainers know"").  If you can do this, you'll be valuable anywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm curious about what material you are dubious about.  It's true, most of the material you'll learn in college won't be useful all the time on the job, but if (more like when) something comes up and you bs'ed your curriculum, at best you'll look inexperienced and at worst you'll look underqualified (he/she has a college degree and doesn't know what a digital signature is?).  If you do it right, you'll already be experienced by the time you graduate.  Then, when a senior engineer says something like:

""yeah, we use a custom transport protocol for internal service calls to XYZ; yeah it's kinda dumb but it saves network bandwidth bc the link is spotty on the intranet.  Anyway, it's UDP with a custom retry handler, the code is in the 'com.arvent.internal.app.net.client.retry'.  Why don't you take a look and let me know if you have questions""

you'll be like ""okay, it's kinda weird but makes sense.  Maybe we should refactor that in the future"" instead of ""what??  What is UDP?? Que es transport layer?? Dang, I didn't study anything in college because I didn't think it would be useful!?!?  Maybe it actually \*is\* better that the university gatekeeps  curriculum instead of me, since the university knows almost everything about the relevant areas of research in Computer Science and I -- some random schmuck that was born 20-something years ago -- know nothing!  Now I have to spend the next week and weekend reading up on computer networking and writing some ditzy, hacky solution that will get torn apart during code review instead of making love to my gf and playing fortnite.  NOOOOOOO""

&amp;#x200B;

I was being kind of a dick but yeah, if you study hard it'll pay off bc the best/senior engineers all know the stuff you're studying, and have applied it so that the software/apps they write are better than naive implementations of solutions in their respective technical domain.  That's if you're working for a company with proficient engineers.  If not, you'll have to BE the best/senior engineer and implement it all yourself, as well as create a POC, schedule a meeting (on lync or some equivalently shitty corp app) with the team leads, manager, and some business people, and show how much the new implementation kicks ass when compared to the current shitty naive implementation.  It's more work, but if/when you do this, everyone will look at you like you're god.  Pretty cool, esp if you're young.  Anyway, those are my souped-up-on-coffee-saturday-morning thoughts/ramble.

Cheers and good luck"
"935","For me it was process and paperwork, everything aside from coding that goes into a project with hundreds of devs on it."
"936","I remember back when I was a senior and I did an internship, I started stressing over just how important being able to learn specific technologies was. I didn't understand how to approach learning a framework, or a new devops tech or... well, really anything at a high level of abstraction because I had gotten so used to staring at everything as low-down as possible.   


That and best practices. But, those come with experience..  


My advice would be to make an ACTUAL product using a modern stack in your chosen technologies. It doesn't have to be big or complicated, just something you can show and say ""I learn this myself"". It shows that you're capable of picking things up and also gives you a head start on technology.  


As CS people, we come out of school with a really great foundational understanding, but very little applied knowledge.  So, showing you're ready to pick up tech used in the real world is pretty important.   


So if you're a Java guy for instance, maybe make a simple project using Spring Boot for an API, with a detached UI written in a Javascript framework. Honestly, if you can figure just that part out, that's huge. Separating a backend from a frontend is the common practice for new web-based software. That immediately puts you in the lead of junior devs.   


If you're lower down, do an embedded project with some arduinos or something to automate a real-world process (even if it's pretty contrived).   


If you're a data guy, make an NLP or CV model or something. Or do an ETL project with Spark or something like that.  


There's a lot of other tech you can get your hands on and play with, like Docker &amp; Kubernetes and CICD tools and such. But, honestly, that's reaching pretty far as you won't even understand why those tools exist until you see software development in the wild.  


  
If you don't want to work alone on a project built from scratch, look into some open-source stuff. There's tons and tons of projects that need contributors, so even if you can just fix bugs and write tests, you could get your hands dirty on a real project that's used by the industry."
"937","Go study oop, data structures, loops, databases. Ull encounter them a lot


- dev of 5 years."
"938","One thing Ive learned in CS that I apply at the start of every task is the concept of completeness. In CS 170 you do proofs and you have to logically assert that 100% of edge cases must be covered. All that practice really does prepare you for creating new features and data schemes because youve been trained to catch all the angles and think big enough to make a tech plan to cover everything. It also helps with thinking about edge cases to test your code. Operating systems has also come in handy a few times, permissions and all that."
"939","I think the theoretical stuff is where you gain the most understanding of how to write good code honestly. I understand that a front end dev probably does not need to know the intricacies of  how things like an operating system work, but a lot of people shipping code dont just write stuff for the web.
I dont think it is ever a bad thing to learn more about computers if you are going to be shipping code. My education, seemed to have prepare me relatively well for a job as an engineer and it was really theoretical."
"940","Get as many"" useful"" certifacations as you can."
"941","When I first entered a real job, testing was my biggest weakness.  My degree was extremely theoretical, but even we touched on some business principals and software development lifecycle stuff.  But testing? Nada.

I found it easy enough to learn new frameworks, languages, software development methodologies, etc, but it took me a while to get to grips on how and where to write good tests.  Tests are a big part of what separate maintainable code from spaghetti hell!"
"942","Real programming and debugging skill.  If the largest program you've written is a mere 1000 lines long, you might have huge issues."
"943","My course work was very hardcore and very practical I was making 3 different apps a semester all ussually in 3 different languages and platforms.

Working is like a dream I feel like I'm doing nothing compared to school"
"944","damn, that sounds like a lot. which CS program did you do?"
"945","I honestly felt like beyond data structures &amp; algorithms, computer organization, and two electives in databases and software engineering, most of my coursework was not useful for work. Most beyond that was in more abstract theory, which isn't bad to know.. but I can't say it has helped me directly or indirectly whatsoever.

I would say a good skill to have is simply being able to learn things on your own/know how to use your resources efficiently. In a lot of jobs you'll be learning a new language, framework, etc. You'll be expected to solve problems on your own (to some extent), and I know too many new grads who expect to be hand held through every error message and cant read documentation.

Also just common sense clean code and DRY practices. I worked on way too many senior projects in school with people who would still rewrite the same code in several places without considering generalization, and do x, y variable names. Modularity is also good."
"946","Well I went into a UI junior dev role right out of college and practically nothing I learned applied. I mean I took a single class that was very basic HTML/CSS/JS, and it was after I already had multiple internships doing exactly that but more in depth. I only took it for the easy credits lol.


CS degrees tend to be more about theory and data structures and fundamentals of computing, not applicable skills. Those you learn on your own."
"947","the reality is OP that even in practice, code is ultimately just a bunch of functions, data structures, if statements, loops, etc. that you learn in school

just on a much higher scale, but dont stress it"
"948","I'm not sure if I count as jr or not after 5 years but I can speak to this a bit. Their were two large gaps that existed for me specifically.

1. Database classes weren't a mandatory in my program, so I had to pick up all my database skills quickly and on the fly. Not incredibly difficult but it would have been nice to have more structured exposure to it in my degree. This is also a fault of my own having actively taken other CS elective over it. I wouldn't really trade anything I did take, so I wish I just had the time for the extra class I suppose.
2. Most of your work will be learning 3rd party libraries and frameworks. This again isn't incredibly difficult, but it would have been nice to be exposed to that reality in college, perhaps with assignments required the usage of some list of third party libraries.

Edit:

Bonus round. Learn GIT or some other version control. One more quick and easy, but knowing it right off the bat will be nice. Also experiment with IDE's. You won't always have a choice in what you use, so it's night be somewhat familiar with everything that's a fairly big player."
"949","To me it was knowing all the pieces, but not really knowing how to make a puzzle yet.  

Or like knowing all the letters in the alphabet, maybe even some words, but now you have to write a book or be a poet.  

To me it takes time and experience no matter how smart you are in college."

"951","From my college days: 

1. Version control. We didn't have free stuff like git back then, but it is something you certainly need to learn today.

2. Using whatever tools you have at hand. This one is a bit difficult to explain, but in college we were forced to reinvent the wheel every time we wrote code. Rarely did we get to use any libraries or frameworks, and had to write everything from scratch, for the purpose of learning. 

This kinda ingrained a mentality that you'd need to roll out your own code for everything, and using libs etc. felt like ""cheating"". This one actually stuck with me for a long time. 

3. Logistics of software. Deployment, upgrades / maintenance, management, etc."
"952","You'll be surprised by the theoretical CS stuff that *does* pop up in your day to day life as a software engineer."
"953","Version control is the biggest thing missing from school usually.  Git, svn, whatever."
"954","I will say that one thing you notice when you start going through your career that a lot of the picky details you learn in CS \*only\* come up in interviews. ""Can you explain polymorphism? What's the difference between an interface and an abstract class?"" These things don't ever become important in the actual job. Only in the interviews."

"960","Corporate politics and how that plays out. I've yet to see programming ability make a huge difference. 

If anything, tone back the fancy stuff. If you write an interpreter to solve a problem, someone else has to maintain it."
"961","You're not asking me, but one of the big ones I find that shocks folks new to the industry is the requirement o support other people's code. 

I get them into interviews and ask, ""can you support this code base"" and the response is ""I can write it from scratch!""  

Sure... but that' wasn't the question.  Learning to work with code someone else wrote is 10x harder.  Writing code that someone else can support is 20x."
"962","not a junior dev, also don't have a CS degree, but here's my opinion wrt practicality:

the best employers in the industry care about the theory, and the knowledge -- you'll need them to pass the interview process

they do not care about the degree itself, at all (once you get an interview, that is)

soo, you should still consider it as being relevant to the real world due to its importance when it comes to interviewing, even if you never, ever use it on the job itself.

but you can also take into account the fact that not learning something now means you won't be able to learn it later. you just have more spare time to dedicate now, which makes it easier. if you learn it now, forget all of it, and interview somewhere a year or 2 from now, relearning will be easier than learning from scratch"
"963","I very much agree with the relearning part."
"964","A lot of CS is just theory but most devs in the industry with a CS degree are honestly better than those without a CS degree.

Most relevant is DS&amp;A as lots of the work may be optimizing queries to speed things up which means you need to know how to code efficiently. 

CS classes also introduce you to harder coding exercises than you'd experience from things like Udemy or bootcamps. So a CS degree will usually prepare you better for more difficult challenges."
"965","&gt;  as lots of the work may be optimizing queries to speed things up which means you need to know how to code efficiently.

Most of the code people do is based on readability and maintainability, not efficiency. Most people don't work at Google and don't have to build algorithms that have to perform really quickly. As long as your app isn't laggy, your boss will be happy at your typical mid-sized company."
"966","From my experience this isn't always the case. 

I worked on inhouse software that's used in a warehouse and by making the functions ran after a box is scanned perform quicker from around 6 seconds down to 2, productivity went up by over 30%. People were able to process their orders quickly.

This isn't big N either. Lots and lots of places are like this."
"967","Once you get your first job you are pretty much being paid to learn. Few new grads are worth half what we pay them for the first 3-6 months.

If you're concerned about getting hired, just look at job postings for the company you want to work at. Then one by one learn about the technologies they list in the must have/desirable section on their job postings.

However, I wouldn't stress too hard. Work your ass off in school. Play less Minecraft/COD. Will be fine. If you don't get a good internship, think about doing some volunteer work. All of my friends that did volunteer work found real work within 3 months of graduating."

"977","If you could shut down all cryptomining you would do more to reduce global energy usage than anyone or any company has individually done so far.  With the probable exception of Ghengis Khan, and he did it by killing a lot of people (also, energy use wasn't a concern back then)."
"978","Do you know of a good source to learn more about the energy use of cryptomining?"
"979","Not off the top of my head, but look around and you'll find some.  On a small scale it's not that bad, but with mining now being as wide spread as it is, and the process being inefficient (by necessity), it ends up wasting a lot of energy.  
  
On it's own this isn't a death sentence to cryptomining, it's only as dirty as what creates the electricity for it, the issues would be drastically reduced if it were powered entirely off of green energy for example (hey, idea:  make crypto miners powered off of wind, solar, nuclear, and geothermal energy to offset their creation costs), but excess energy demand typically takes the dirtiest/cheapest energy sources because it's the easiest to bring to market."
"980","Proof of stake algorithms were supposed to reduce the power waste problems from proof of work algorithms in mining (that give a preference to higher hashrate). But I have fell out of the crypto scene so I don't know if many of the major players have carried through with that conversion."

"982","There are multiple causes of environmental issues.  
  
Want another one?  Engineer a control system that makes a nuclear plant automatically shut down in the event of negligent maintenance.  
  
Nuclear is by far the cleanest and best energy source current technology allows for.  But, when it goes wrong it goes really wrong (despite that, it has the lowest deathprint per kwh produced).  And it only goes wrong when they're not maintained properly.  So create software that can't be bypassed that forces regulatory compliance."

Those are example of being a more thoughtful and detail-oriented professional."
"1002","&gt; I guess the realization I had about the whole thing, in a nutshell, is that software engineering is more about interpersonal skills than it is about tech.

That's a bit of an overstatement. You just did not understand that in most cases Software Engineering is a team effort, and in a team interpersonal skills matter. Software engineering is nothing like the Hollywood Hacker trope, it's just a pretty typical white collar desk job.

Luckily these skills are trainable. Part of it is just doing it a lot. If it doesn't come natural to you, it's definitely something that you could discuss with your manager. Many companies do courses on these kinds of 'soft skill' subjects."
"1003","I like associating skills with the projects or work experience subsections to which they pertain. That gives the reader a timeframe in which they were used or learned, as well as the context."
"1004","Everyone here bad mouths them, but I'm a hiring manager and I like them. I don't think if you give yourself an arbitrary 9/10 or 10/10 that you're ACTUALLY that skilled at it, but I do use it as a means to easily identify which languages or skills you believe you're better at and which you know but aren't as proficient.  If someone has 3 programming languages listed with different ratings I don't even need to ask them which language I should ask them questions for. 

What I see about these which does annoy me when using these: 

* overly detailed scales (no ticks, but one looks to be 7/10, one 7.5/10, one 8/10 - far too granular)
* Everything is listed as highly rated
* Way too many things listed. Don't rate yourself on 30 different skills. Not even 10
* Soft skills rated. Not useful information really as they tend to be over stated. The one you link - 10/10 hardworking? Like really are you in the literal top 1% of performers when it comes to hardworking-ness? Or do you work really hard like everyone else? I roll my eyes when anyone gives themselves 10/10 on any soft skills. 
* Unsubstantiated claims - and this one drives me NUTS. Give yourself a 4/5 on Java? Fine, but I have to SEE in the rest of your resume where you have used Java and get a good idea from actual words how experienced you are from the rest of your resume. 

So if you really want to use them, do. I don't know of any hiring managers who would throw out your resume for having bars graphs. 

The alternate is to just leave it off, and let the text of your resume to speak for itself. Upon reading I should be able to see in your case for example that you used Java at a job 6 months ago but not at your most recent job. You can always clarify in the actual interview when it matters. Not every interviewer is going to ask, but I usually ask candidates to rate themselves informally or ask what their preferred language is, or what their experience is with a particular language before jumping in with more questions."
"1005","I find it too hard to evaluate my level at a language. I mostly do C++ and the more I program, the more I learn how much I don't know about that language. I've met a lot of other students who think they are good at C++ but have no idea what l and r values are, what metaprogramming is or what Boost is. I feel like someone with 10 years of experience in C++ would rate himself a 5/10 when someone with 1 year of experience would rate himself a 7/10."
"1006","Yup, and a person I was interviewing with was blown away when someone I was interviewing with 10 years of experience exclusively in Java rated himself as 7/10. The person interviewing with me questioned him, and he replied that well he certainly could know more about java compilers. 

Really, just about everyone rates them around 7/10. I've had interns rate themselves 7/10. It's kind of like the pain scale when you're at the hospital. When you walk in and say your pain is at a 7/10 that's not very important, but if later you're saying it's 10/10 worst pain you've ever had clearly you've gotten worse - the actual score is meaningless - it's the delta which matters. Java listed at 7/10. PHP listed at 5/10? Great I've learned something - not that you're 7/10 on Java but you know Java quite a bit better than PHP."
"1007","Honestly, i know this isn't answering your question, but my personal opinion, don't waste your time with platforms like Upwork or Fiverr. They're a race to the bottom, and you'll be competing against outsourcing firms who quote cheap prices and often deliveyr pretty crappy work. Work on your own projects, there's lots of examples of indie makers that make small websites that bring them in a decent amount of money from subscriptions, and concentrate on doing well in your career. 

Those platforms usually don't pay anywhere nearly as much as you can make if you manage to get a promotion or an offer from a Big-N or an investment bank. As a software developer, the best way to get paid more, is by getting promoted or a competing offer. 

This is all assuming you're in a country like the USA, UK, Australia, etc by the way. If you're in south east asia where salaries might be much lower, then yeah, Toptal, Fiverr, Upwork might all be ok. Toptal the better option."
"1008","This is solid advice thanks. I'm in the UK so luckily those options apply to me. Getting promotions and applying to Big-Ns is a good idea but I've just finished university and started a new job which I'm enjoying so far."
"1009","Ah ok, yeah i'm in the UK aswell. Then in all honesty, don't waste your time on Fiverr or Upwork. I tried it aswell at the start of my career and was a waste of time. But if you really want to do something part time give Toptal a go. Or just join a community like [wip.chat](https://wip.chat) or indie hackers and use those as motivation and support for your side projects."
"1010","I think most people either develop a project of their own hoping it turns profitable or go the freelance direction. I agree with the other comment upwork and fiver are traps. You might be able to find contract work on job boards or if you have any networking in tech this might be what the use it for. There's probably another subreddit specifically with advice on freelancing in general.."
"1011","And which subreddit is it?"
"1012","tutor lmaoo"
"1013","There are a few ways.

Offer to build websites for small businesses around your area. I mean as long as you don't charge them $1000 for a bootstrap page, they will most likely want to do it.

Make mobile apps, dude if you can somehow make vscode run on my iPad, I will pay you $30 for that app even if I have to manually compile it.

Build your own startup, this is a bit more difficult as you do need to find a founder, I do not recommend doing this alone. And to get any type of professional investment, you most likely have to work full-time for it, and your education/work background also matters quite a bit in this context.

There are many more: creating open-source tools and ask for a donation, make indie games, manage servers for people.

&amp;#x200B;

I would stay away from fiver and upwork, if you are in NA, the average pay is too low, you just can't compete."

"1017","I used PPH when I was starting self teaching programming to force myself to use APIs and things I would never chose to use in my own projects. As others have said it was a race to the bottom but I was learning so was not treating it as a real source of income. Some of the clients I got stuck with me and I have a steady stream of jobs coming from some large companies. Not enough to quit my day job but a very nice bonus once in a while. 

People go on those sites to get things dead cheap but with that they dont get very good customer service (most of the time). I provided great customer service from the get go and was always contactable so when they came back for other jobs I could charge a more realistic price."
"1018","For me, projects are just popping out, all the time. Some are from friends that have software companies and sometimes need some consulting / freelance development and sometimes it's for direct clients that are looking for website for their businesses and somehow know me / some of my friends/family.

When I started in the industry (4-5 years ago), it was not like that, but with time passing I was making more and more contacts and I always made sure to mention that I am looking for more work (outside my regular job)."
"1019","Build a freemium plugin for an established platform.  E.g., Wordpress plugins."
"1020","I am making a small game on unity and trying to monetize it afterwards, it might fail but at least I have learned something. I feel like my scope is small enough for me to be able to finish it alone but I need outsource some textures etc"
"1021","PM me about the texture you need outsourced. I do digital art and 3D modeling as a hobby so I might be able to help out."
"1022","Development work is so weird. In a past life (not programming) I could easily apply my skill set outside of my day job and make more than I was in my 9-5. The trade off was that the 9-5 was steady and reliable income, the side work was usually too small for any legit company to take on, and it was inconsistent, but I could charge multiples of my wage for the jobs (best rate I negotiated was a flat fee that rounded out to $500/hr over 2 weekends). I just kept a steady balance of that stuff until I knew I would be changing careers and shifted my priorities. 

Programming, it seems, yields less money outside of a 9-5, no additional career development potential, and very little potential to turn that into a steady gig. Ive always had the OPs question too. 

Like, how can I go find some mom-n-pop level business and charge between $100-500/hr to do what amount to a few weekends worth of dev work, and isnt terribly far off from what Im already doing? Even my current boss recommends I consult, but the work isnt there. I guess its that for work that is a side hustle, the lack of commitment allows for remote work and global level competition. Instead of competing with people from my community Im competing with people living on a fraction of what I need just to pay my internet bill."
"1023","I didn't use any third party platforms whatsoever. I just asked around and went to networking events and tried to make connections the old fashioned way. Friends of friends of freinds, that kind of thing. Getting started was the hardest part, but once you have a portfolio you can reference and people to vouch for you then it isn't too hard. Half of the battle is just marketing/grinding. Making the website is the easy part normally."
"1024","Im young and have a lot of non-technical friends from school, friends-of-friends, etc. In particular, quite a few of my friends went to art school and they always seem to be needing help changing their sites around. I fairy regularly get contacted to assist with minor things like hosting, WP, website coding, zapier, etc. Every now and then Ill get a bigger project. None of this ever pays better than my full-time SWE position, but its extra cash, I usually learn something new and Im helping out people in my extended network."
"1025","I don't know why so many people get the impression that you can always earn money on the side using your programming skills.

Sure, some people do, but there's absolutely nothing unique about programmers in this regard. A industrial plumber could make money on the side by servicing residential clients. A tax accountant could make money on the side by setting up their own financial planning firm and working outside of business hours.

The honest truth is that it's really fucking hard to make money on the side of a full-time job, and most people that talk about talking to small business owners or monetising WordPress plug-ins say this because it's possible, not because they've actually done it themselves. The problem with chatting to small businesses and clients is that they often work in business hours (i.e. 8-6), and more often than not they want any service they're paying substantial money for to be performed in those hours.

As far as my experience goes, I had a very brief side gig transitioning broken WordPress builds over to the Umbraco CMS. A friend of mine reached out regarding a tailoring business he had set up, and asked me to help fix his website. Since it was a super basic CRUD site, I ported the template over to Umbraco and hooked everything up in a night. From there, I noticed that the original developer had left his watermark on other sites, and most of the time the site was broken in some obvious way - so I decided to message all of his old clients and ask if they wanted someone to do what I did for my friend, and many of them said yes.

I gave up because I initially wanted this to be a one-time thing, where I build a product and leave, but I found it hard to pawn people off to freelance friends of mine for new work. One person even offered to pay double to keep me instead of going to my (frankly, better) freelance buddy. The work itself was mind-numbingly boring, and it started to creep into my day job, where I would fend off emails during the day and spend most of my lunch break sneaking in calls/emails/code to satisfy an out-of-hours client. Most importantly, working a full stressful day, getting home at 6:30, and starting work all over again was hard, and refusing to say no to what seemed like easy money led me to hate writing code. In the end, I lucked out when a friend of mine went into contracting as I was about to throw in the towel, and I managed to gradually push everyone over to him.

All in all, I made some decent money, but it wasn't worth it. Looking back, I would've traded it all for those evenings free."
"1026","For programming, it will almost always be more efficient to increase your primary income over any type of side-gig.

Find a better paying job or get promoted. Both of these are very attainable goals and will increase your primary income by 20, 50, 100%. As opposed to any side-gig where you'll be lucky getting a return of minimum wage.

Do gigs outside of your main job because you *enjoy* it."
"1027","Hey there son, folks around here know me as ""The Manager."" Let me give you a little bit of advice, line by line.  


&gt; would like to work in a job where I'll get to build AI powered software and hopefully not data analysis work.

This is a poor attitude to have. Hey, it's great to have dreams, it's great to strive for something, heck I encourage it in my employees. But, fact of the matter is, you're just a young buck fresh outta school and you need to start at the bottom! You're not going to be the big cheese without putting in your dues. I'm just saying, try not to be close-minded.  


&gt; The reason I'd like to avoid data analysis jobs is that I absolutely  love coding, and these jobs only involve coding to the extent of  preprocessing the data. 

A job is just a title. ""Coding"" means a lot of different things. Think about the *value you are providing*. Someone who can generate meaningful reports can directly affect the business ROI, and more than anything, money talks in this world.  


&gt; My question is, what kind of skills do I need to acquire besides python  and deep learning models building ? I'd like to dedicate the next 6  months to build these skills. 

Don't just think about technical stuff. You need soft skills too. Learn how to conduct yourself in a professional manner. Learn how to work in an office setting. Learn how to improve your work ethic. Learn how to give presentations and understand everything from the code you write to the QA testing processes to the business side of things.  


&gt; Also what kind of job titles do I need to look for ? I guess it wouldn't  be data scientist/analyst. Does it fall into the category of machine  learning engineer ? 

Wouldn't focus too much on the job titles, focus on the job *responsibilities.* Look at thejob description and technology used, look at the company's mission statement, look at folks you may be working with on LinkedIn. That will provide a lot more information than just a couple of words in a title."
"1028","Uh, a data science/machine learning position right out of college isn't a big deal. He should absolutely aim for that. My former company hired Junior data scientists and ML engineers out of college all the time.

The rest of your advice seems pretty reasonable. But, those positions have entry levels."
"1029","Thank you for your detailed answer !

&gt;But, fact of the matter is, you're just a young buck fresh outta school and you need to start at the bottom

Yes this is true, what would a career path to achieve that ''big dream'' be ? What jobs should I start with to slowly build that expertise ?

&gt;Don't just think about technical stuff. You need soft skills too.

That is so true and 100% agree with you. I've been steadily working on building and perfecting them. I'm aware the biggest challenge for this kind of job is to communicate with people who don't necessarily understand the technical stuff and present the impact of your work in simple terms.

&gt;Wouldn't focus too much on the job titles, focus on the job responsibilities.

Alright I'll keep that in mind.

Thank you again for your detailed answer !"
"1030","You want to do AI and not understand your data? Yikes. AI is all about data analysis, data sanitizing, and so forth."
"1031","&gt;You want to do AI and not understand your data?

Sorry if my words were misleading, what I meant is that I don't want my job to be just ''understanding the data '' but also building something out of it. For sure you need the preprocessing skills first before you can build anything from the data .."
"1032","Learn math, study block chain, learn cryptography, and then stop talking about blockchain."
"1033","&gt;  stop talking about blockchain

why?"
"1034","There's nothing inherently groundbreaking about it. It won't solve all of our problems. It isn't even that interesting anymore. Feel free to get into it. It is applied cryptography. Have fun."
"1035","I dont know any silver bullet in technology space. Calling out Blockchain saying it doesnt solve all problems is bullshit. Try to look at the area of problems it solves. Needs more time for customer adaptation. I was asking for a list of skills to have for blockchain"
"1036","I gave you one in my first post. Learn math and cryptography. Then you'll realize that blockchain is just one of many types of applied crypto."
"1037","you need a time machine to travel to 2017"
"1038","I would learn AWS over GCP."
"1039","I mean, all of these are good to know, but I wouldn't learn TS on its own. Do you know a front end framework like React, Vue, or Angular? TS seems a bit out of place in this list, being mostly used for front end.

Regarding GCP: couldn't hurt to learn, but as someone else suggested, I'd also recommend Azure or AWS over GCP, just because they're much more common."
"1040","It could sound weird, I feel more intrigued by GCP than AWS and Azure because I find Google's technology more interesting. Like the design of MapReduce is one example."
"1041","Experience and overall exposure to the jargon. It's basically like an accent. Move somewhere new and after a while, somebody notices you sound different."
"1042","Regarding presentations and Q&amp;A talks, I think all you can do is just lots of practice. Practice alone, then with someone you feel comfortable with, then a small group of you can etc...  as for the stuff you said before that, maybe its just a subconscious mental block affecting you or even a legit medical issue.  I often straight up forget words in similar situations.  Think its just a nerves thing."
"1043","yeah I agree. I think it is a mental block thing. It can be kind of upsetting sometimes when it happens, but it's probably something that requires a lot of exposure first to push through."
"1044","Apart from practicing a lot, reading can help. Some technical authors have reputations as ""great explainers"", and I find that reading their literature tends to help."
"1045","I like this advice :)

Any recommendations?"
"1046","You'll likely need to find some authors who write well about the topics you're interested in. My research area has mostly been relational databases, and I realize it's not for everyone. In that area, I can recommend [C.J. Date](https://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/2136)."
"1047","I listen to technical podcasts almost exclusively to help with my technical communication skills. As another commenter said, it's like an accent, repeated exposure helps you pick up the jargon and patterns of speech."
"1048","I started listening to Programming Throwdown on Spotify during my commutes. Any other tech podcasts you would also recommend?"
"1049","[Software engineering radio](https://www.se-radio.net/) and [CoRecursive](https://corecursive.com/about/) are my two favorites. I especially like that SE Radio has a different host and guest each episode, so I don't get sick of the host. I'll check out Programming Throwdown."
"1050","Just talk your self through your code when you review and document (out loud if you need to)"
"1051","Focusing on the specific field isn't the best way to apply Cal Newport's idea of acquiring valuable skills. The reason is that machine learning fields are likely to change a *lot* in the future, and the popular areas and technologies will be different 5 years from now compared to today.

Instead, step back one level and ask what skills are highly valuable and transferable across different areas of machine learning. For example:

1) general research skills

2) management and leadership skills

3) software engineering skills

4) applied mathematics and statistics skills

5) business knowledge

6) particular programming languages (e.g., Python)

7) etc.

If you gain a wide variety of experience in those skills, you'll be able to apply your skills to *any* area of machine learning. Those are the sorts of rare, valuable skills that Cal Newport has in mind."
"1052","Id say nlp is still nascent. Models are improving quickly, but concrete use cases are still limited. Computer vision is useful with a ton of concrete use cases. But its easy enough that its really not that much more valuable than being a regular software engineer."
"1053","NLP has way more potential and room to grow imo. Even the best NLP systems and chatbots are quite bad, to be frank, partially because language itself is extremely complex. For vision we can do a lot of the tasks quite well such as facial recognition, object detection, style transfer, etc. and there is less room for improvement and exploration imo. NLP has a much higher ceiling imo and we have not even tapped into a fraction of its potential yet"
"1054","Sometimes the cost of trying to answer a question is larger than any difference in the options. Just pick one and get started. Even if you were to convince yourself of a good reason to pick one, your next problem will be CV applied to X or CV applied to Y?"
"1055","Both are in demand right now, and will be for the near future, so both are valuable. I don't think you need to worry too much about which is more valuable as long as demand for both skills still exceeds the supply of relevant talent. However, there is both transferable knowledge and domain-specific knowledge, so I would focus on learning the transferable knowledge first as /u/tl_throw suggests, then pivot to learning domain-specific knowledge if you decide you prefer one over the other. Many companies have jobs specific to NLP or Vision, but few have jobs involving both, so it can still make sense to specialize to some degree."
"1056","Ability to learn new frameworks quickly, good hygiene. That's basically all you need."
"1057","And ability to implement things in a scalable, testable and maintainable way"
"1058","the technical skills will depend on the job, a lot of desirable skills ive seen. listed are React, Redux, Angular, jquery, and formatting/css

for non technical skills, sociability is huge, i wouldnt want someone working with me who wont interact with their coworker and be friendly and promote good company culture. other than that, more obvious ones are work ethic, signs of good mental health, being physically healthy"
"1059","A year and a half is sufficient time to get a proper publication out if you're diligent and you have a good team supporting you. If you want to be a researcher, publishing and presenting that work are the things that give you credibility. There's really no other way around it.

Talk to your advisor about this so he or she can help you carve out a project where you can take the lead and have something done before you graduate."
"1060","Thanks for the reply. I suppose you're right, there's not really an alternative way.

This may be appropriate for another entire question, but what should a student do if their advisor isn't exactly helpful? I don't want to talk negatively about my advisor, but he's one of those professors who seem more like a business person than a researcher. He rarely ever advises students and even setting up an appointment with him is extremely difficult. This also happens to be one of the reasons why I decided not to do my PhD in the lab I'm at now and go for some work experience instead."
"1061","That's a crappy situation and it sucks you're in it. Your advisor is supposed to help you establish your own credibility by guiding you throw the research process. If he's not doing that, then going elsewhere is a pretty good idea, whether that means going off to industry or finding a different advisor (as another reply mentioned). In some groups, there's a fairly senior PhD student or postdoc who can give good guidance. That might be another thing to look for if you don't want to switch advisors."
"1062","Look into changing advisors? I did and while tough at the time mid-PhD it was the best decision I ever made in grad school. Also while nice to have publications or posters or something, finishing an MS without that is not the rarest thing, at least in my experience in the US."
"1063","On your resume have your Master degree and the expected graduation date, and then under that, put the info about the ML &amp; DL research that you're doing."
"1064","If you've contributed to code, tools, etc., you should absolutely put that down. When we're hiring, aside from publications that's what I'll look at. Publications aren't required unless you're getting close to finishing your PhD, in which case I would be a little concerned."
"1065","To become respected SDE:

1.	Buy a suit and take lots of good photos for the gram (bitches love the gram)
2.	Write out answers from leetcode on whiteboard and take photos saying leetcode hard done in 15 min. Proud of myself
3.	Buy followers so you have social proof confirming you are respected SDE on the gram

You are now an SDE with the respect of others, as you have desired."
"1066","Not exactly what I was looking for but Ill take it."
"1067","He wasnt the hero we needed, but he was the hero we deserved."
"1068","For me, what I remember depends on the importance of the information to me. The thing about school is I would remember it for the exam and then say I don't need this information anymore. You got to get out that mindset of there being an exam. There is no exam in the workforce. Just projects divided into a bunch of tasks. You need the information forever, so make note of that.  

Also, if your memory is actually bad, write things down in a notebook."
"1069","Thank you thats good perspective!"
"1070","1) Understand the ops (infrastructure, platform engineering, etc) side of things. Not just in an abstract sense, but an actual day-to-day functional sense. Maybe do a rotation with an ops team, if your employer does that sort of thing. It a rare software developer that really becomes great at their job without a real solid understanding of ops.

2) Learn to write trustworthy tests. The whole point is for you to be confident about your code, not to jump through some mandatory hoop. If youre not able to write tests youre confident about, thats a skills gap you should fill. If you view tests as a waste of time, thats a mind-set that should change. 

3) Really learn about the actual business domain youre working in. Engineers who can actually relate technical work to actual business value are basically wizards that have a magic wand they can wave to justify their teams budget. 

4) Use the standard patterns and common programming models. Theres a bunch of them, it takes a while. Theres no shortcut here, you just have to actually write a wide variety of different software on different platforms with different frameworks and libraries to develop the skill."
"1071","Thanks for the input I will try to look for different ways to develop this skill"
"1072","Programming a lot helps. Pick up some devops skills, know your way around infrastructure. Deliver solutions to problems."
"1073","Thanks for the tip!"
"1074","One thing you can try is utilizing what you learnt with actual work. Implement small projects alone or with another developer. Learning Python? Develop a working app with it. It can be something simple, like address book implementation with proper back-end. Learning AWS? Change the backend so it would use AWS instead of a local database."
"1075","Thank you for the input, I learned python and java in my first year and havent touched them since and thats my fault."
"1076","Come up with projects that deliver value. Deliver projects with value. Repeat. Also if you are ever going to complain to a superior about something regarding process have a solution ready to correct it."
"1077","Thank you !"
"1078","Just completely depends on the company. In general be comfortable with designing things and organizing code effectively, in addition to the typical coding stuff."
"1079","Do you mind explaining the typical coding stuff. I am asking that because I feel that something that could be an obvious skill for someone at a competitive tech company might not be that obvious for me. I am looking to interview because I feel like I have not gained much experience and expertise working in fintech as compared to someone at working at FANG."
"1080","Sure, and thanks for calling that out. I think in general just knowing about the major data structures and algorithms, but also knowing how to use them with a given problem and language. For instance, if you are going to interview in C++ then make sure you know the basic containers and stl components for solving problems efficiently. 

In general I would expect someone coming in as an SDE2 (here at least) to dissect a problem into proper sub-components, design a solution to a problem based on these sub-components, leveraging the right pieces of a language to solve it, and explaining the trade-offs or ambiguities that can stem from the problem and the proposed solution.

On the non-tech side I would expect them to know how to effectively communicate with others. How well do they deal with conflict, and what is an approach they would use for a given scenario? If something misses a deadline how do you handle that? It's important to clearly explain your processes and thoughts to others, so I would definitely be looking for that."
"1081","Its true to an extent that the coding test arent applicable to real world problems but most companies use them anyway to find the potential candidate in their problem solving thinking. Thats how the system works. 

I personally despise them too but it is how it is. The thing is most IT interviews on site usually last much longer than other field interviews which makes me feel fatigued from having to study these algorithm and data structure just for the sake of nailing the tests but at the end of the day, it benefits me as well since I know more. Knowledge is power after all. My two cent."
"1082","What if those same concepts get more streamlined towards the company tech stack and job profile needs and be relevant to what's is applicable, all these concepts(ds and algos) are applied everyday to solving a real world problem, scoping it out to what's required rather then a generalist approach makes it irrelevant as the author I post mentioned that he had to go back in time and look at merge sort which is more relevant if you are frsh out of school, as a senior developer your challenges are different and scoping it out is where the money is at"
"1083","Thats why most senior developers who have few years of experience tend to forget those ds and algo stuff and feel the need to revise them again when they looking for a new company. You can tell from majority of the people on this sub that brags about doing LeetCode 8 hours a day just to get into the big name companies based on their post. 

To me, I personally dont think you need to focus so hard on it. Its more of an ability to think logically and solve real world problem at the end of the day rather than memorizing LeetCode solutions which brings no value."
"1084","It's worth it in that they filter out people who don't know the basics very well and who can't model simple problems in code."
"1085","Well you wouldn't get so far in your career if it wasn't for solving those small problems, seems counter intuitive when you have to focus on things totally unrelated to job, CS is vast and when you specialize in a certain field, generic tests like ones from leetcode are a archaic way to really evaluate someone."
"1086","I wouldn't call testing the basics 'archaic'."
"1087","That's not what I intended to say, I meant the way of testing is archaic, may be a new format which includes both fundamentals and job specific requirement like a small project in that line of work is what is needed"
